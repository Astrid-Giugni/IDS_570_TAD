Note: this doesn’t mean that you want to forget everything that you learned in R up to now! The analyses that we conducted in R allowed us to develop a granular understanding of how to represent and measure textual features. The tasks we will do in Python will be less “transparent”, but you don’t want to give up the intuition you developed so far.\nIf you have never worked with Python, you can find a beginner friendly, step by step guide on how to download Python and set up VS Code (the environment you will use for Python–think of it as the Python version of R studio): here.\nIf you have worked with Python before, you can use whichever environment you want.\nQuick note: you want Python 3.11.x. The bottleneck is scikit-learn, which doesn’t play well with the most recent version of Python.\nA second note about learning Python: If you are new to Python, the first thing that you will see as you look at tutorials is that Python is an object-oriented language. I have added a link that takes you to realpython.com, which is a great resource for learning Python. But don’t worry too much about understanding all the finer points of this from the get-go! The TA’s and I will help you use the code that I give you as an example and then you can start learning more about objects and classes and all that jazz.\n\nAs we go along this tutorial: I am re-introducing the training wheels. I am including links to some of the major Python concepts as they come up in the code!\n\n\n\nThe first few steps that we are going to take are very similar to what we did in R: the logic is the same, but the syntax is different. The first thing that we need to do is to read the text and then check that things look correct!\nIn R, what we do at the beginning is:\n\nload a text file into memory,\ncheck how long it is,\npreview the beginning,\nand try to spot obvious encoding or OCR problems early (that is, does the text look weird?).\n\nWe are now going to do the same step in Python. The main difference is that we are going to use a path-handling tool in Python, Path. We are then going to actually read the file with this line: text = path.read_text(encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"replace\"). Here, I am asking Python to decode the text using utf-8 and to replace any unreadable characters instead of crashing. The replacement is the Unicode replacement character: �.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\npath = Path(\"texts/wealth.txt\")\ntext = path.read_text(encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"replace\")\n# The lines above read the wealth.txt into a long string\n\nprint(\"Characters:\", len(text)) #character count \n\nCharacters: 2411473\n\nprint(\"Lines:\", text.count(\"\\n\") + 1) #line count\n\nLines: 34544\n\n# taking a look that the text looks ok. Similar to head() and slice() in R\nprint(\"\\n--- START ---\\n\")\n\n\n--- START ---\n\nprint(text[:800])\n\nAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\n\nby Adam Smith\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n INTRODUCTION AND PLAN OF THE WORK.\n\n BOOK I.

This is the balance of the annual produce and\n      consumption. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce, it has\n \n\n\nThe print() function is something that will come up over and over again. If you get lost by how I am using it, do click on this explanation.\nThe next step is to tokenize the text. This is the Python version of unnest_tokens() in tidytext. But in Python, we have to do this using a regex: so, hopefully, you feel comfortable with the regex unit from Week 2. We are also going to lowercase. This tokenizer keeps alphabetic words (and contractions), so it ignores numbers and hyphenated compounds; that’s a simplification for today, not a general rule.\nSince we also want to run some checks on our process (as we did in R), we are going to inspect the most frequent tokens using Counter, the Python parallel to tidytext’s count(word, sort =TRUE).\nMaking things look nicer: You can skip this explanation, if you are new to Python. This is equivalent to: print(w, c). I am just trying to make the display more readable for the class!\nIn the next block below, I am going to use an f-string inside print(). An f-string is a way to format text, so f\"{w:&gt;12} {c}\" means (working inside out):\n\ntake the value of w and convert it to text, right-align it inside a space 12 character wide;\nthen when you print separate the columns (the two spaces between {w:&gt;12} and {c})\n\n\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ntokens = re.findall(r\"[A-Za-z]+(?:'[A-Za-z]+)?\", text.lower())\nprint(\"Tokens:\", len(tokens))\n\nTokens: 380080\n\nprint(\"Unique tokens:\", len(set(tokens)))\n\nUnique tokens: 9475\n\ncounts = Counter(tokens)\nprint(\"\\nTop 25 tokens:\")\n\n\nTop 25 tokens:\n\nfor w, c in counts.most_common(25):\n    print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\n         the  32244\n          of  24295\n          to  11708\n         and  10284\n          in  9637\n           a  6678\n          it  5392\n       which  4824\n          is  4685\n          be  3828\n        that  3818\n          or  3211\n          as  3088\n          by  2981\n         for  2976\n       their  2523\n        this  2231\n         not  2231\n         are  2168\n        they  2131\n        have  2119\n        upon  2112\n        from  1970\n         but  1962\n       those  1925\n\n\nThe library Scikit-learn is going to allow us to import a standard list of stopwords. More importantly, Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python and we will use it more than once!\nWe are going to convert the list of pre-defined stopwords into a set because it will make filtering tokens more efficient. We can then use the in-place OR operator |= to add all the elements of our custom stopwords to the standard stopwords (the link at “sets” will also explain |=).\nAside: if you go to the tutorial, you might see that there is another OR operator | . This operator creates a new set. I am just modifying the preexisting one by adding the custom stopwords.\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS\n\nstopwords = set(ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS) #turn it into a set\n\n# This is optional and I am only using this as an example of syntax (hence the choice of silly terms)\ncustom_stopwords = {\"barnacle\", \"putine\"}\n\nstopwords |= custom_stopwords\n\n# let's check how many stopwords we have and what they look like\nprint(\"Stopwords loaded:\", len(stopwords))\n\nStopwords loaded: 320\n\nprint(\"Sample:\", sorted(list(stopwords))[:25])\n\nSample: ['a', 'about', 'above', 'across', 'after', 'afterwards', 'again', 'against', 'all', 'almost', 'alone', 'along', 'already', 'also', 'although', 'always', 'am', 'among', 'amongst', 'amoungst', 'amount', 'an', 'and', 'another', 'any']\n\n\nNow that we have our stopwords as we want them, we can apply it to our tokens. We are also going to remove really short tokens (fewer than 3 characters). Something that sometimes throws people off: I am stating the length requirement as a strict inequality. Now look at the code below: do you understand why have len(t) &gt;= 3 ?\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclean_tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stopwords and len(t) &gt;= 3]\n\nprint(\"Tokens (raw):\", len(tokens))\n\nTokens (raw): 380080\n\nprint(\"Tokens (clean):\", len(clean_tokens))\n\nTokens (clean): 148917\n\nprint(\"Unique tokens (clean):\", len(set(clean_tokens)))\n\nUnique tokens (clean): 9156\n\nclean_counts = Counter(clean_tokens)\n\nprint(\"\\nTop 25 tokens after cleaning:\")\n\n\nTop 25 tokens after cleaning:\n\nfor w, c in clean_counts.most_common(25):\n    print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\n       great  1583\n       price  1264\n     country  1240\n     greater  1085\n       labor  1011\n       trade  970\n     produce  945\n   different  855\n    quantity  797\n       value  794\n      people  779\n       money  773\n        land  720\n     revenue  691\n      silver  661\n     capital  657\n        time  636\n       stock  601\n       goods  585\n      market  582\n   countries  577\n     expense  561\n  particular  513\n         tax  513\n        gold  508\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the steps should be very familiar (with a different coding language). The next step is driven by the model itself. Since LDA does not operate on individual words or on a continuous token stream, we are going to be constrained by the structure that it needs. Word2Vec can work on the entire Wealth of Nations at once, but for the sake of continuity, we will stick to the same structure for both models.\nLDA needs to work with documents or, as in our case, pre-defined segments of a longer text. These are the assumptions behind LDA:\n\neach document is a mixture of topics,\neach topic is a distribution over words.\n\nThis forces us to decide what counts as a “document” in our corpus. In some cases, this will be obvious to you: if you have a collection of political speeches, then each speech is a document. In other cases, we have to make a decision. The Wealth of Nations is one long text and we can segment it in a number of ways. There are two common options (each with its one trade-offs): one is to use internal subdivisions, such as chapters; the other is to use fixed-sized segments. We are going to go for the second one and create 800-token chunks.\nNote: both options are legitimate choices. I am picking fixed-sized segments because I know that the chapters in The Wealth of Nations are of varied length and that a single topic (such as labor or political economy) is split over several chapters. The approach I take here also ensures that no single segment dominates the model simply because of its length. LDA tends to work better when documents are not extremely long. But this choice comes with a trade-off: I am losing track of Adam Smith’s structure. For different purposes (that is, for an actual project rather than a class tutorial), I might choose to “chunk” by chapter instead.\n\n# Segmenting\n\nSEGMENT_SIZE = 800  # fixed-size \"document.\" We can always adjust length\n# slice the entire list of tokens from token #0 to the last token, breaking it into chunks of SEGMENT_SIZE.\nsegments = [\n    clean_tokens[i:i+SEGMENT_SIZE] \n    for i in range(0, len(clean_tokens), SEGMENT_SIZE)\n]\n\n#inspect the segmentation\nprint(\"Number of segments:\", len(segments))\n\nNumber of segments: 187\n\nprint(\"First segment length:\", len(segments[0]))\n\nFirst segment length: 800\n\nprint(\"Last segment length:\", len(segments[-1]))\n\nLast segment length: 117\n\n\nEach segment is now a document for LDA: we have 186 segments, which is a good document count for LDA, and segment sizes are consistent (800; last shorter, which is what we expect). Note: I picked 800 somewhat arbitrarily, but it is meant to capture approximately 2-3 paragraphs per segment given what I know of Smith’s writing. Let’s see what word counts in a segment look like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nsegment_counts = [Counter(seg) for seg in segments]\n\n# check: top words in segment 0\nprint(\"Top words in segment 0:\")\n\nTop words in segment 0:\n\nfor w, c in segment_counts[0].most_common(15):\n    print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\n     chapter  33\n       labor  30\n   different  19\n        book  12\n     produce  11\n    division  11\n    employed  11\n     nations  10\n     society  10\n      number  10\n        work  9\n       stock  8\n  particular  8\n      people  7\n       great  7\n\n\nThis also looks reasonable for the opening of the book (chapter, book, division, labor, work, nations, society) and it means that we can proceed to the next step.\nAt this point, we now have two complementary representations of the same text:\n\nsegments: each segment is an ordered sequence of tokens\nsegment_counts: each segment is represented by word counts (bag-of-words)\n\nWe are going to need both representations, but for two different models. Word2Vec learns meaning from local context and word order, so it can work directly with segments. On the other hand, LDA ignores word order and models documents as mixtures of topics, so it requires a bag-of-words representation, which we will build explicitly in the next section.\nWe will begin with Word2Vec, because it extends ideas you have already encountered: a word’s meaning is shaped by the contexts in which it appears. For a good resource on understanding Word2Vec, see here. But, in short, instead of storing explicit co-occurrence counts, Word2Vec learns dense vectors for each word. These vectors are learned by optimizing a predictive task: given a word, predict its surrounding context (or vice versa). The result is a compressed, smoothed representation of the same information we previously counted directly.\nOK, what does this mean in practice for us? Each segment is a sequence of tokens and Word2Vec slides a fixed-size context window across these sequences and learns vector representations that are good at predicting nearby words.\n\n# Key step: Word2Vec training\n\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec  \n\nw2v = Word2Vec(\n    sentences=segments,     # each segment is a list of tokens\n    vector_size=100,        # dimensionality\n    window=5,               # context window (parallel to your co-occurrence window)\n    min_count=10,           # ignore very rare words\n    workers=4,              # number of CPU cores for parallel processing\n    sg=1                    # 1=skip-gram, 0=CBOW\n)\n\nprint(\"Vocabulary size:\", len(w2v.wv.key_to_index))\n\nVocabulary size: 2317\n\n\nWe have to make some choices when we train Word2Vec:\n\nvector_size=100: each word is represented as a 100-dimensional vector (if we choose higher dimension, we capture more information about each word, but it’s slower and requires more text data). Common values in practice: 100-300. 100 is often the default.\nwindow=5 matches what we did in our co-occurrence calculation.\nmin_count=10 keeps the vocab manageable (and its good for a class exercise). Note: the exact choice of 10 (instead of, say, 15 or 20) is based on trail and error. Given that we have 1,395 words in the vocabulary after filtering, I don’t want to be too agressive. For a larger and more varied corpus, I might go for 20.\nImportant: if you have an older machine and it’s freezing; change workers = 4 to 2 or even 1.\nsg=1 (skip-gram) is usually better for capturing rarer, more specific relations.\n\nNow that the model is trained, we can inspect its learned semantic space by asking for a word’s nearest neighbors. The goal is to use cosine similarity to find which word vectors are closest to a given/target word in the vector space. In this case, let’s look at “trade,” “labor,” “price,” “capital,” and “market” to see what kind of results we get.\n\nquick aside if you haven’t worked in Python before: this is the first time we are defining a function using the def keyword.\n\n\n# Nearest neighbors (cosine similarity)\n\ndef show_neighbors(word, topn=10):\n    if word not in w2v.wv:\n        print(f\"'{word}' not in vocabulary.\")\n        return\n    print(f\"\\nNearest neighbors for '{word}':\")\n    for w, sim in w2v.wv.most_similar(word, topn=topn):\n        print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {sim:.3f}\")\n\nfor target in [\"trade\", \"labor\", \"price\", \"capital\", \"market\"]:\n    show_neighbors(target, topn=10)\n\n\nNearest neighbors for 'trade':\n    carrying  0.896\n       round  0.869\nadvantageous  0.857\n    branches  0.849\n      forced  0.839\n      branch  0.837\n     carried  0.833\n       carry  0.829\n      direct  0.826\n     returns  0.822\n\nNearest neighbors for 'labor':\n     laborer  0.872\n        puts  0.860\n        adds  0.851\n      motion  0.849\n       tools  0.834\n distributed  0.827\n     enables  0.822\n    finished  0.817\nconveniences  0.809\n   regulates  0.808\n\nNearest neighbors for 'price':\n       rises  0.832\n        sink  0.811\n      barley  0.806\n         low  0.804\n      prices  0.792\n        rise  0.789\n       bread  0.789\n       lower  0.785\n    somewhat  0.782\n       falls  0.775\n\nNearest neighbors for 'capital':\n    capitals  0.862\n       fixed  0.830\n   withdrawn  0.830\n   regularly  0.829\n       stock  0.819\n    replaces  0.813\n     employs  0.812\n    employed  0.812\n     hinders  0.807\n     returns  0.795\n\nNearest neighbors for 'market':\n    supplied  0.812\n   effectual  0.807\n     thither  0.799\n      demand  0.788\n     brought  0.784\n        come  0.770\n       bring  0.770\n     markets  0.764\n    bringing  0.760\n overstocked  0.750\n\n\nFor trade: the terms that we are getting indicate that Smith is using structural and institutional language in conjunction with this term. We have verbs like carrying, carried, and shipping (possibly used as a noun…), as well as structural qualifiers such as branches, returns, and direct. Some words are perhaps more surprising and would require more investigation (such as round).\nFor labor: there is a strong sign the model has learned labor as an activity embedded in the language of key economic activities, such as productive, distributed, enables, and, more obviously, but very reassuring, laborer and tools.\n\nAs an exercise for the students: what do you think of the neighbors for price, capital, and markets? Any surprises?\n\nI think that at this point, it will be helpful to compare with the co-occurrence analysis we did last week. Let’s compute simple co-occurrence neighbors using the same as in week 6 (window = 5) and compare.\n\n# Co-occurrence neighbors (window = 5)\n\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\n\nWINDOW = 5\ncooc = defaultdict(Counter)\n\nfor seg in segments:\n    for i, token in enumerate(seg):\n        start = max(0, i - WINDOW)\n        end = min(len(seg), i + WINDOW + 1)\n        for j in range(start, end):\n            if i != j and seg[j] != token: # otherwise \"trade\" will be the closest to \"trade\" etc.\n                cooc[token][seg[j]] += 1\n\ndef show_cooc_neighbors(word, topn=10):\n    print(f\"\\nCo-occurrence neighbors for '{word}':\")\n    for w, c in cooc[word].most_common(topn):\n        print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\nNow we can look at them and compare with Word2Vec neighbors defined by cosine similarity:\n\nfor target in [\"trade\", \"labor\", \"price\"]:\n    show_cooc_neighbors(target, topn=10)\n\n\nCo-occurrence neighbors for 'trade':\n     foreign  192\n       great  164\n     capital  127\n     country  119\n consumption  92\n    employed  82\n     greater  80\n     carried  70\n    monopoly  68\n    branches  67\n\nCo-occurrence neighbors for 'labor':\n     produce  227\n    quantity  216\n       wages  202\n       price  193\n        land  161\n     greater  139\n       stock  122\n       value  122\n  productive  120\n     country  119\n\nCo-occurrence neighbors for 'price':\n      market  200\n       labor  193\n       money  158\n        corn  142\n        real  116\n        rise  106\n commodities  104\n        high  101\n    quantity  94\n     produce  90\n\n\n\nWhat differences do you note in these lists? Both represent “neighbors” of our target words, but obtain through two different methods.",

The analyses that we conducted in R allowed us to develop a granular understanding of how to represent and measure textual features. The tasks we will do in Python will be less “transparent”, but you don’t want to give up the intuition you developed so far.\nIf you have never worked with Python, you can find a beginner friendly, step by step guide on how to download Python and set up VS Code (the environment you will use for Python–think of it as the Python version of R studio): here.\nIf you have worked with Python before, you can use whichever environment you want.\nQuick note: you want Python 3.11.x.

If you get lost by how I am using it, do click on this explanation.\nThe next step is to tokenize the text. This is the Python version of unnest_tokens() in tidytext. But in Python, we have to do this using a regex: so, hopefully, you feel comfortable with the regex unit from Week 2. We are also going to lowercase. This tokenizer keeps alphabetic words (and contractions), so it ignores numbers and hyphenated compounds; that’s a simplification for today, not a general rule.\nSince we also want to run some checks on our process (as we did in R), we are going to inspect the most frequent tokens using Counter, the Python parallel to tidytext’s count(word, sort =TRUE).\nMaking things look nicer: You can skip this explanation, if you are new to Python. This is equivalent to: print(w, c). I am just trying to make the display more readable for the class!\nIn the next block below, I am going to use an f-string inside print(). An f-string is a way to format text, so f\"{w:&gt;12} {c}\" means (working inside out):\n\ntake the value of w and convert it to text, right-align it inside a space 12 character wide;\nthen when you print separate the columns (the two spaces between {w:&gt;12} and {c})\n\n\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ntokens = re.findall(r\"[A-Za-z]+(?:'[A-Za-z]+)?\", text.lower())\nprint(\"Tokens:\", len(tokens))\n\nTokens: 380080\n\nprint(\"Unique tokens:\", len(set(tokens)))\n\nUnique tokens: 9475\n\ncounts = Counter(tokens)\nprint(\"\\nTop 25 tokens:\")\n\n\nTop 25 tokens:\n\nfor w, c in counts.most_common(25):\n    print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\n         the  32244\n          of  24295\n          to  11708\n         and  10284\n          in  9637\n           a  6678\n          it  5392\n       which  4824\n          is  4685\n          be  3828\n        that  3818\n          or  3211\n          as  3088\n          by  2981\n         for  2976\n       their  2523\n        this  2231\n         not  2231\n         are  2168\n        they  2131\n        have  2119\n        upon  2112\n        from  1970\n         but  1962\n       those  1925\n\n\nThe library Scikit-learn is going to allow us to import a standard list of stopwords. More importantly, Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python and we will use it more than once!\nWe are going to convert the list of pre-defined stopwords into a set because it will make filtering tokens more efficient. We can then use the in-place OR operator |= to add all the elements of our custom stopwords to the standard stopwords (the link at “sets” will also explain |=).\nAside: if you go to the tutorial, you might see that there is another OR operator | . This operator creates a new set. I am just modifying the preexisting one by adding the custom stopwords.\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS\n\nstopwords = set(ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS) #turn it into a set\n\n# This is optional and I am only using this as an example of syntax (hence the choice of silly terms)\ncustom_stopwords = {\"barnacle\", \"putine\"}\n\nstopwords |= custom_stopwords\n\n# let's check how many stopwords we have and what they look like\nprint(\"Stopwords loaded:\", len(stopwords))\n\nStopwords loaded: 320\n\nprint(\"Sample:\", sorted(list(stopwords))[:25])\n\nSample: ['a', 'about', 'above', 'across', 'after', 'afterwards', 'again', 'against', 'all', 'almost', 'alone', 'along', 'already', 'also', 'although', 'always', 'am', 'among', 'amongst', 'amoungst', 'amount', 'an', 'and', 'another', 'any']\n\n\nNow that we have our stopwords as we want them, we can apply it to our tokens. We are also going to remove really short tokens (fewer than 3 characters). Something that sometimes throws people off: I am stating the length requirement as a strict inequality. Now look at the code below: do you understand why have len(t) &gt;= 3 ?\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclean_tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stopwords and len(t) &gt;= 3]\n\nprint(\"Tokens (raw):\", len(tokens))\n\nTokens (raw): 380080\n\nprint(\"Tokens (clean):\", len(clean_tokens))\n\nTokens (clean): 148917\n\nprint(\"Unique tokens (clean):\", len(set(clean_tokens)))\n\nUnique tokens (clean): 9156\n\nclean_counts = Counter(clean_tokens)\n\nprint(\"\\nTop 25 tokens after cleaning:\")\n\n\nTop 25 tokens after cleaning:\n\nfor w, c in clean_counts.most_common(25):\n    print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\n       great  1583\n       price  1264\n     country  1240\n     greater  1085\n       labor  1011\n       trade  970\n     produce  945\n   different  855\n    quantity  797\n       value  794\n      people  779\n       money  773\n        land  720\n     revenue  691\n      silver  661\n     capital  657\n        time  636\n       stock  601\n       goods  585\n      market  582\n   countries  577\n     expense  561\n  particular  513\n         tax  513\n        gold  508\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the steps should be very familiar (with a different coding language). The next step is driven by the model itself. Since LDA does not operate on individual words or on a continuous token stream, we are going to be constrained by the structure that it needs. Word2Vec can work on the entire Wealth of Nations at once, but for the sake of continuity, we will stick to the same structure for both models.\nLDA needs to work with documents or, as in our case, pre-defined segments of a longer text. These are the assumptions behind LDA:\n\neach document is a mixture of topics,\neach topic is a distribution over words.\n\nThis forces us to decide what counts as a “document” in our corpus. In some cases, this will be obvious to you: if you have a collection of political speeches, then each speech is a document. In other cases, we have to make a decision. The Wealth of Nations is one long text and we can segment it in a number of ways. There are two common options (each with its one trade-offs): one is to use internal subdivisions, such as chapters; the other is to use fixed-sized segments. We are going to go for the second one and create 800-token chunks.\nNote: both options are legitimate choices. I am picking fixed-sized segments because I know that the chapters in The Wealth of Nations are of varied length and that a single topic (such as labor or political economy) is split over several chapters. The approach I take here also ensures that no single segment dominates the model simply because of its length. LDA tends to work better when documents are not extremely long. But this choice comes with a trade-off: I am losing track of Adam Smith’s structure. For different purposes (that is, for an actual project rather than a class tutorial), I might choose to “chunk” by chapter instead.\n\n# Segmenting\n\nSEGMENT_SIZE = 800  # fixed-size \"document.\" We can always adjust length\n# slice the entire list of tokens from token #0 to the last token, breaking it into chunks of SEGMENT_SIZE.\nsegments = [\n    clean_tokens[i:i+SEGMENT_SIZE] \n    for i in range(0, len(clean_tokens), SEGMENT_SIZE)\n]\n\n#inspect the segmentation\nprint(\"Number of segments:\", len(segments))\n\nNumber of segments: 187\n\nprint(\"First segment length:\", len(segments[0]))\n\nFirst segment length: 800\n\nprint(\"Last segment length:\", len(segments[-1]))\n\nLast segment length: 117\n\n\nEach segment is now a document for LDA: we have 186 segments, which is a good document count for LDA, and segment sizes are consistent (800; last shorter, which is what we expect). Note: I picked 800 somewhat arbitrarily, but it is meant to capture approximately 2-3 paragraphs per segment given what I know of Smith’s writing. Let’s see what word counts in a segment look like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nsegment_counts = [Counter(seg) for seg in segments]\n\n# check: top words in segment 0\nprint(\"Top words in segment 0:\")\n\nTop words in segment 0:\n\nfor w, c in segment_counts[0].most_common(15):\n    print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\n     chapter  33\n       labor  30\n   different  19\n        book  12\n     produce  11\n    division  11\n    employed  11\n     nations  10\n     society  10\n      number  10\n        work  9\n       stock  8\n  particular  8\n      people  7\n       great  7\n\n\nThis also looks reasonable for the opening of the book (chapter, book, division, labor, work, nations, society) and it means that we can proceed to the next step.\nAt this point, we now have two complementary representations of the same text:\n\nsegments: each segment is an ordered sequence of tokens\nsegment_counts: each segment is represented by word counts (bag-of-words)\n\nWe are going to need both representations, but for two different models. Word2Vec learns meaning from local context and word order, so it can work directly with segments. On the other hand, LDA ignores word order and models documents as mixtures of topics, so it requires a bag-of-words representation, which we will build explicitly in the next section.\nWe will begin with Word2Vec, because it extends ideas you have already encountered: a word’s meaning is shaped by the contexts in which it appears. For a good resource on understanding Word2Vec, see here. But, in short, instead of storing explicit co-occurrence counts, Word2Vec learns dense vectors for each word. These vectors are learned by optimizing a predictive task: given a word, predict its surrounding context (or vice versa). The result is a compressed, smoothed representation of the same information we previously counted directly.\nOK, what does this mean in practice for us? Each segment is a sequence of tokens and Word2Vec slides a fixed-size context window across these sequences and learns vector representations that are good at predicting nearby words.\n\n# Key step: Word2Vec training\n\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec  \n\nw2v = Word2Vec(\n    sentences=segments,     # each segment is a list of tokens\n    vector_size=100,        # dimensionality\n    window=5,               # context window (parallel to your co-occurrence window)\n    min_count=10,           # ignore very rare words\n    workers=4,              # number of CPU cores for parallel processing\n    sg=1                    # 1=skip-gram, 0=CBOW\n)\n\nprint(\"Vocabulary size:\", len(w2v.wv.key_to_index))\n\nVocabulary size: 2317\n\n\nWe have to make some choices when we train Word2Vec:\n\nvector_size=100: each word is represented as a 100-dimensional vector (if we choose higher dimension, we capture more information about each word, but it’s slower and requires more text data). Common values in practice: 100-300. 100 is often the default.\nwindow=5 matches what we did in our co-occurrence calculation.\nmin_count=10 keeps the vocab manageable (and its good for a class exercise). Note: the exact choice of 10 (instead of, say, 15 or 20) is based on trail and error. Given that we have 1,395 words in the vocabulary after filtering, I don’t want to be too agressive. For a larger and more varied corpus, I might go for 20.\nImportant: if you have an older machine and it’s freezing; change workers = 4 to 2 or even 1.\nsg=1 (skip-gram) is usually better for capturing rarer, more specific relations.\n\nNow that the model is trained, we can inspect its learned semantic space by asking for a word’s nearest neighbors. The goal is to use cosine similarity to find which word vectors are closest to a given/target word in the vector space. In this case, let’s look at “trade,” “labor,” “price,” “capital,” and “market” to see what kind of results we get.\n\nquick aside if you haven’t worked in Python before: this is the first time we are defining a function using the def keyword.\n\n\n# Nearest neighbors (cosine similarity)\n\ndef show_neighbors(word, topn=10):\n    if word not in w2v.wv:\n        print(f\"'{word}' not in vocabulary.\")\n        return\n    print(f\"\\nNearest neighbors for '{word}':\")\n    for w, sim in w2v.wv.most_similar(word, topn=topn):\n        print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {sim:.3f}\")\n\nfor target in [\"trade\", \"labor\", \"price\", \"capital\", \"market\"]:\n    show_neighbors(target, topn=10)\n\n\nNearest neighbors for 'trade':\n    carrying  0.896\n       round  0.869\nadvantageous  0.857\n    branches  0.849\n      forced  0.839\n      branch  0.837\n     carried  0.833\n       carry  0.829\n      direct  0.826\n     returns  0.822\n\nNearest neighbors for 'labor':\n     laborer  0.872\n        puts  0.860\n        adds  0.851\n      motion  0.849\n       tools  0.834\n distributed  0.827\n     enables  0.822\n    finished  0.817\nconveniences  0.809\n   regulates  0.808\n\nNearest neighbors for 'price':\n       rises  0.832\n        sink  0.811\n      barley  0.806\n         low  0.804\n      prices  0.792\n        rise  0.789\n       bread  0.789\n       lower  0.785\n    somewhat  0.782\n       falls  0.775\n\nNearest neighbors for 'capital':\n    capitals  0.862\n       fixed  0.830\n   withdrawn  0.830\n   regularly  0.829\n       stock  0.819\n    replaces  0.813\n     employs  0.812\n    employed  0.812\n     hinders  0.807\n     returns  0.795\n\nNearest neighbors for 'market':\n    supplied  0.812\n   effectual  0.807\n     thither  0.799\n      demand  0.788\n     brought  0.784\n        come  0.770\n       bring  0.770\n     markets  0.764\n    bringing  0.760\n overstocked  0.750\n\n\nFor trade: the terms that we are getting indicate that Smith is using structural and institutional language in conjunction with this term. We have verbs like carrying, carried, and shipping (possibly used as a noun…), as well as structural qualifiers such as branches, returns, and direct. Some words are perhaps more surprising and would require more investigation (such as round).\nFor labor: there is a strong sign the model has learned labor as an activity embedded in the language of key economic activities, such as productive, distributed, enables, and, more obviously, but very reassuring, laborer and tools.\n\nAs an exercise for the students: what do you think of the neighbors for price, capital, and markets? Any surprises?\n\nI think that at this point, it will be helpful to compare with the co-occurrence analysis we did last week. Let’s compute simple co-occurrence neighbors using the same as in week 6 (window = 5) and compare.\n\n# Co-occurrence neighbors (window = 5)\n\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\n\nWINDOW = 5\ncooc = defaultdict(Counter)\n\nfor seg in segments:\n    for i, token in enumerate(seg):\n        start = max(0, i - WINDOW)\n        end = min(len(seg), i + WINDOW + 1)\n        for j in range(start, end):\n            if i != j and seg[j] != token: # otherwise \"trade\" will be the closest to \"trade\" etc.\n                cooc[token][seg[j]] += 1\n\ndef show_cooc_neighbors(word, topn=10):\n    print(f\"\\nCo-occurrence neighbors for '{word}':\")\n    for w, c in cooc[word].most_common(topn):\n        print(f\"{w:&gt;12}  {c}\")\n\nNow we can look at them and compare with Word2Vec neighbors defined by cosine similarity:\n\nfor target in [\"trade\", \"labor\", \"price\"]:\n    show_cooc_neighbors(target, topn=10)\n\n\nCo-occurrence neighbors for 'trade':\n     foreign  192\n       great  164\n     capital  127\n     country  119\n consumption  92\n    employed  82\n     greater  80\n     carried  70\n    monopoly  68\n    branches  67\n\nCo-occurrence neighbors for 'labor':\n     produce  227\n    quantity  216\n       wages  202\n       price  193\n        land  161\n     greater  139\n       stock  122\n       value  122\n  productive  120\n     country  119\n\nCo-occurrence neighbors for 'price':\n      market  200\n       labor  193\n       money  158\n        corn  142\n        real  116\n        rise  106\n commodities  104\n        high  101\n    quantity  94\n     produce  90\n\n\n\nWhat differences do you note in these lists?

    "text": "LDA Topic Modeling:\nUp to this point, we have used Word2Vec to explore how individual words relate to one another based on shared contexts. This approach is well suited to questions like:\n\nWhich words behave similarly across the text? How is a concept used, qualified, or framed?\n\nThis is really helpful if you are trying to think about how, for example, different texts portray the same terminology and concepts. But what if we want to focus on the text as a whole instead? This is the question that topic models—and LDA in particular—are designed to answer.\n\nSome background on LDA:\nIn class, we briefly discussed the Dirichlet distribution. I emphasized that you don’t need to know the details in the background in order to actually work with LDA topic modeling. However, you do need to understand some basics about distributions so as to develop some intuition. First, if you need a clear and to the point reminder of binomial distributions, look at Josh Starmer’s youtube channel [he is a faculty member at UNC; not a random channel]. If you want a more robust discussion, see Peter Dalgaard, Introductory Statistics with R (2008), chapter 3 [statistics applications is one of the reasons I started the semester with R]. Once you are comfortable with that, use the discussion in chapter 6 of Text as Data for Dirichlet distribution (or take it on faith for now!).\nWith that behind us, the next step that we are going to do is the parallel to creating a DFM, but we have to organize our text into the data structure required by LDA. We already have segments and segment_counts, we need a dictionary (this is a key data structure in Python, follow the link if you are unfamiliar with it) and a document-term matrix (DTM). LDA works with a “bag-of-words” representation, so we need to get word counts for each segment. This should be very familiar for our work in R.\nIn the code below, Dictionary builds a vocabulary from our corpus and creates a mapping between each unique word (like “trade”) and a unique integer ID (assigned sequentially, in the order that new words are first encountered when gensim scans the corpus).\n\nfrom gensim.corpora import Dictionary\n\n# Build a dictionary from the segments\ndictionary = Dictionary(segments)\n\n# do some cleaning\ndictionary.filter_extremes(\n    no_below=10,    # must appear in at least 10 segments\n    no_above=0.5   # must appear in no more than 50% of segments\n)\n\nprint(\"Vocabulary size after filtering:\", len(dictionary))\n\nVocabulary size after filtering: 1711\n\n# Convert segments to bag-of-words format\ncorpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(seg) for seg in segments]\n\n#Take a look\nprint(\"First document (bow format):\")\n\nFirst document (bow format):\n\nprint(corpus[0][:10])\n\n[(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)]\n\n\nIn the filtering step we are mirroring what we did in R when we removed very rare words and stopwords, but with a slightly different logic. Remember, we are trying to create topics and rare words in the corpus won’t really define a what the text is “about,” so we filter out words that appear in fewer than 10 segments by using no_below=10 (out of 186 segments). Conversely, really frequent words tend to be too general to distinguish topics, so we filter for words that appear in more than half of the segments using no_above=0.5. Note: both these values are heuristics that tend to work well for a first run of the model. But you might decide that, based on your question, you want to try different filters!\nAt this point, we have the same kind of data structure we relied on in R for bag-of-words models: documents represented by word counts. The next step will simply convert these counts into the specific input format required by the LDA implementation we are using.\nWe are finally done with preprocessing and we can actually fit the LDA model (yay!). To reiterate: these “topics” are computational constructs; they are estimates of latent word distributions that, taken together, explain the observed word counts reasonably well.\n\n# Train LDA model\n\nfrom gensim.models import LdaModel\n\nlda = LdaModel(\n    corpus=corpus,\n    id2word=dictionary,\n    num_topics=8,\n    random_state=42,\n    passes=10,\n    alpha=\"auto\",\n    eta=\"auto\"\n)\n\nprint(\"LDA model trained.\")\n\nLDA model trained.\n\n\n\nWhy these hyperparameter settings:\n\nnum_topics=8: small enough to read–it’s a good starting place\npasses=10: this is how many times the model goes through the corpus during training. More passes will produce more stable topic estimates, but they take longer to compute. The size of your corpus matters here: with a small corpus, each document will carry a lot of weight and topic estimates are more sensitive to noise, so I will tend to do 10-15 passes. With a larger corpus, you can get away with fewer passes (5-10-ish) because the model encounters each word in more contexts. I don’t have a a clear cut rule because the answer also depends on: “how much time and GPU to you have?”\n\nA nuanced point: the model also has a default number of iterations that we are not changing. Iterations are different from passes. The iterations control how thoroughly the model updates its estimates during each visit: these are the internal optimization steps that occur during each pass.\n\n\nWhen we train an LDA model, we are not only choosing how many topics to use. We are also choosing “how flexible” the model is in assigning topics to documents and words to topics\n\nalpha=\"auto\": the alpha setting governs the document-topic distribution. That is, does the model assume that documents (segments in our case) tend to focus on one or fewer topics (low alpha) or does it assume that they contain a mix of many topics (higher alpha)? When we set it to \"auto\", we allow the model to learn this behavior from the data. I chose \"auto\" because we created arbitrary segments in the text based on a pre-selected number of tokens. If I had a different corpus, I would have to think more about alpha.\n\nWhat does this mean? In gensim‘s LDA implementation, the default setting for the alpha parameter is ’symmetric’. This means that alpha has the same value for all topics. When alpha is symmetric, gensim calculates it using this formula: \\(\\alpha\\) = 1.0 / number of topics. When I say that based on the structure of the corpus, I would have to think about it more, I mean this quite literally: I will base my decisions on the exact question that I am asking with topic modelling and the details of the corpus.\nIf you really want to dig into this, here are the resources that I would review before making these decisions: “Finding scientific topics” (2004); “Optimising Semantic Coherence in Topic Models” (2011); and for good measure, I am including the original paper on LDA, though it wouldn’t be my first stop for practical decisions, “Latent Dirichlet Allocation” (2003).\n\neta=\"auto\": you can think of this setting as, how “chatty” do we want our topics to be? A low eta encourages topics to focus on fewer words, while a high eta encourages more words per topic. I usually select auto as it allows the model to infer how sharp (fewer words) topics should be based on the actual distribution of words in the corpus. In technical literature, you will find this parameter denoted by \\(\\beta\\).\nrandom_state: this will probably seem the most opaque setting. It fixes the sequence of random choices the model makes during initialization. This is a step for reproducibility and transparency. The goal is to be able to obtain the same output from run to run, but [flashing warning light, sirens blaring, warning, warning] only in the case that for each run you have the same corpus, the same preprocessing, the all same hyperparamaters settings, the same software versions (!), and the same hardware behavior. We do what we can to be as transparent as possible. Sometimes, life has other plans.\n\nFor more information on all the hyperparameters in gensim’s LDA follow the link. If you really want to dig further into this topic, I strongly recommend this paper.\nAt the end of the day: LDA results depend on modeling choices and random initialization. Different runs can produce different, but equally reasonable, topic structures.\nOK, we can finally enjoy the fruits of our labor.

Topic 2 (foreign trade and manufactures) and Topic 6 (precious metals and banking) emerge as the most prevalent, together accounting for over a third of the book’s content. This makes sense given Smith’s focus on international commerce and monetary systems. Topic 1 clearly represents taxation and fiscal policy (tax, taxes, duties, Britain), while Topic 3 captures discussions of war, military spending, and colonial companies—particularly the East India Company. Topics 0 and 4 both relate to labor and wages, but Topic 0 emphasizes the relationship between landlords, rent, and maintenance, while Topic 4 focuses more directly on wage rates, employment, and labor markets. Topic 5 centers on agricultural commodities and their prices over time (corn, wheat, cattle, century, improvement), likely reflecting Smith’s extended discussions of agricultural economics and historical price movements. The distribution of topic prevalence tells us something important (and reassuring given what is known about Smith’s work): Smith doesn’t devote equal attention to all themes—international trade and monetary systems clearly dominate his analysis.\nAs we look at the visualization, we can perhaps get a better sense of some of the structural distribution of these topics. The topic prevalence plot across segments reveals the book’s structure and confirms that LDA has captured meaningful thematic shifts as Smith moves through his argument. Notice how Topic 2 (foreign trade) shows strong presence in the middle and later portions of the book, which aligns with Smith’s extended treatment of commercial policy in Books IV and V. Topic 6 (metals and banking) appears in concentrated bursts rather than being evenly distributed, suggesting Smith returns to monetary questions at specific points in his argument. Topic 3 (war and colonies) is relatively rare overall but spikes sharply in specific segments—these likely correspond to his discussions of colonial administration and military expenditure. The uneven distribution of topics across segments is exactly what we should expect from a structured argument: Smith isn’t randomly mixing concepts and arguments, he’s developing them systematically. If all topics appeared uniformly across all segments, it would suggest either that our segmentation strategy failed to capture the book’s organization, or that LDA wasn’t identifying meaningful thematic distinctions. Instead, the clear peaks and valleys should give us some reassurance that both our preprocessing choices and the model’s topic assignments are capturing real patterns in how Smith structured his economic treatise",

    "text": "In this tutorial, we’ll explore three measures of lexical complexity (also called lexical diversity or lexical richness) using two historical texts; one you know well by now, the other one is a new mystery text that you can find on Canvas:\n\n“The Circle of Commerce” by Edward Misselden (1623)\n“A69858.txt”\n\nWe want to see if the two texts differ in terms of vocabulary diversity in a meaningful way.\nWhat is Lexical Complexity? Lexical complexity measures how varied a writer’s vocabulary is. A text with high lexical diversity uses many different words, while a text with low diversity repeats the same words frequently. We’ll learn three different, but well-validated, measures:\n\nType-Token Ratio (TTR) - The simplest measure\nGuiraud Index - Corrects for text length\nMeasure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) - The most sophisticated measure\n\n\n\nWe are going to introduce a new library for MTLD (koRpus). This is a great library to be familiar with because it includes functions for automatics language detection, hyphenation, several indices of lexical diversity (including MTLD), and indices of readability. It’s also well documented and a standard package in academic work.\n\nlibrary(readr) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidyr) \nlibrary(tidytext) \nlibrary(ggplot2) \nlibrary(udpipe)\nlibrary(koRpus)\n\n#install.packages(\"koRpus.lang.en\") # You will need to do this once\nlibrary(koRpus.lang.en)\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 14))\n\n\n# Read the text files\ncircle &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A07594__Circle_of_Commerce.txt\")\nmystery &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A69858.txt\")\n\n# Create a tidy data frame with both texts\ntexts_df &lt;- tibble(\n  document = c(\"Circle of Commerce\", \"A69858\"),\n  author = c(\"Misselden\", \"Unknown\"),\n  text = c(circle, mystery)\n)\n\n# Display basic information\ntexts_df %&gt;%\n  select(document, author) %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(caption = \"Our Two Texts\")\n\n\nOur Two Texts\n\n\ndocument\nauthor\n\n\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have our two texts loaded, let start with Type-Token Ratio (TTR). TTR is the simplest measure of lexical diversity. It’s calculated as:\n\\[\\text{TTR} = \\frac{\\text{Types (unique words)}}{\\text{Tokens (total words)}}\\]\n\n# Tokenize the texts and do some basic cleaning (review week 2 if you are usure!)\ntokens &lt;- texts_df %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = str_to_lower(word))\n\n# Calculate TTR for each text\nttr_results &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  group_by(document, author) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    tokens = n(),                    # Count total words\n    types = n_distinct(word),        # Count unique words\n    ttr = types / tokens,            # Calculate TTR\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Display results\nttr_results %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 3,\n    caption = \"Type-Token Ratio Results\",\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"Author\", \"Total Words\", \"Unique Words\", \"TTR\")\n  )\n\n\nType-Token Ratio Results\n\n\nDocument\nAuthor\nTotal Words\nUnique Words\nTTR\n\n\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n5942\n1317\n0.222\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n33894\n4769\n0.141\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I am using a new function, knitr::kable(x), to display the results as a simple table. It takes whatever is the x (=data frame or matrix) and makes it into a table.\nLet’s visualize the results that we just got:\n\n# Create a bar plot comparing TTR\nggplot(ttr_results, aes(x = author, y = ttr, fill = author)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(ttr, 3)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Type-Token Ratio Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Higher values = more diverse vocabulary\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Type-Token Ratio (TTR)\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, max(ttr_results$ttr) * 1.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this first measure, we see that Misselden’s text has a lower TTR than the unknown one. What does this mean, exactly? Well, we can see that in The Circle of Commerce only 14.1% of the words are new word forms (that is, a word string–after normalization–that has not appeared before in exactly that form in the text so far), while for the “mystery” text, 22.2% of the words are new word forms. That is, TTR is a measure of “non-repetition” of word forms. Another way to think about it is that for The Circle of Commerce, if you encounter any random word in the text, that’s a 14.1% chance that it’s a word type you haven’t seen before. So, The Circle of Commerce has lower lexical variety than A69858: it repeats itself more than A69858.\nWarning: longer texts will almost always have a lower TTR score than shorter texts, even if they have a richer vocabulary (can you see why?). Earlier, we saw that A69858 has, in total, 5942 words, while Circle of Commerce has, in total, 33894. The two texts are substantially different in length, so we need to double check with a length-corrected measure (such as Guiraud and MTLD).\nWhy you might still want to compute TTR: it’s a standard across disciplines and you will encounter it in publications, so you need to know what you are looking at. Anyone reading a corpus analysis will recognize it and be able to understand what it represents. TTR is a standard measure of lexical variety. It’s easy to audit and easy to reproduce. It’s also a good first diagnostic check.\n\n\n\nThe Guiraud Index (also called Root TTR) solves the text length problem by using a mathematical correction:\n\\[\\text{Guiraud} = \\frac{\\text{Types}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Tokens}}}\\]\nBy dividing by the square root of tokens instead of the raw count, the Guiraud Index is more stable across different text lengths. This adjustment is a practical approximation that assumes that as the length of a text doubles, its vocabulary does not double. The square root in the Guiraud index is there because vocabulary growth in texts is empirically sublinear: as a text gets longer, new words appear more slowly. The Guiraud Index essentially asks: how many distinct word forms does a text introduce once we partially correct for the fact that longer texts repeat terms more often?\nCalculate Guiraud Index:\n\n# Calculate Guiraud Index for each text\nguiraud_results &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  group_by(document, author) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    tokens = n(),\n    types = n_distinct(word),\n    guiraud = types / sqrt(tokens),   # Guiraud formula\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Display results\nguiraud_results %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 3,\n    caption = \"Guiraud Index Results\",\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"Author\", \"Total Words\", \"Unique Words\", \"Guiraud Index\")\n  )\n\n\nGuiraud Index Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\nAuthor\nTotal Words\nUnique Words\nGuiraud Index\n\n\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n5942\n1317\n17.085\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n33894\n4769\n25.904\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s visualize it:\n\n# Create a bar plot comparing Guiraud Index\nggplot(guiraud_results, aes(x = author, y = guiraud, fill = author)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(guiraud, 2)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Guiraud Index Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Length-corrected measure of lexical diversity\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Guiraud Index\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, max(guiraud_results$guiraud) * 1.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis result gives a very different picture from what we noticed with TTR: The Circle has a more varied vocabulary than the mystery text when we partially account for the length of the text.\nHowever, you want to make sure that when you compare texts using the Guiraud Index, you are looking at texts that are of similar genre and (though less so) similar length. Different types of texts are associated with different demands on vocabulary and rhetorical strategies (for example, a legal argument will require different vocabulary choice than a news report of the same court proceeding). Because the index still depends on text length and genre, there is no universal ‘benchmark’ scale. Instead, values should be interpreted relatively, as we are doing here.\nThis leads us to:\n\n\n\nWhat is MTLD?\nMTLD is the most sophisticated measure we’ll use. It was designed to account for the problems of the measures above. TTR and Guiraud essentially ask: given a text of length N, how many distinct word forms does it contain? MTLD instead asks: how long can a text continue before its lexical diversity drops below a fixed threshold? It works by:\n\nReading through the text sequentially\nCalculating a running TTR as it goes\nCounting how many times the TTR drops below 0.72 (this has been determined empirically across many text types and genres). Once you detect that the document’s TTR drops below 0.72, you count one factor. Then you reset and restart computing TTR on the next chunk of text.\nThe result is the average “length” needed before vocabulary starts repeating and it’s computed by:\n\n\n\n\nThe Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) is computed as:\n\\[\n\\text{MTLD} = \\frac{N}{F}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\nN = total number of word tokens in the text\nF = total number of factors, including any partial factor at the end of the text\n\nIn practice, MTLD is usually computed in both directions (forward and backward through the text), and the final value is the mean of the two:\n\\[\n\\text{MTLD}_{\\text{final}} =\n\\frac{\\text{MTLD}_{\\text{forward}} + \\text{MTLD}_{\\text{backward}}}{2}\n\\]\nHigher MTLD = more diverse vocabulary (the author can go longer before repeating words).\nLet’s compute this second version (both forward and backward through the text using the koRpus package (and use the formatting that it requires). Note: koRpus gives you a number of options which you can find here.\n\n# Function to calculate MTLD for a text\ncalculate_mtld &lt;- function(text_string, doc_name) {\n  # Create a temporary file (koRpus requirement)\n  temp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".txt\")\n  writeLines(text_string, temp_file)\n  \n  # Tokenize with koRpus\n  tokenized &lt;- tokenize(temp_file, lang = \"en\")\n  \n  # Calculate MTLD\n  mtld_result &lt;- MTLD(tokenized)\n  \n  # Extract the MTLD value\n  mtld_value &lt;- mtld_result@MTLD$MTLD\n  \n  # Clean up\n  unlink(temp_file)\n  \n  return(mtld_value)\n}\n\n# Calculate MTLD for both texts\nmtld_results &lt;- texts_df %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    mtld = calculate_mtld(text, document)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  select(document, author, mtld)\n\nLanguage: \"en\"\nLanguage: \"en\"\n\n# Display results\nmtld_results %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 2,\n    caption = \"MTLD Results\",\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"Author\", \"MTLD\")\n  )\n\n\nMTLD Results\n\n\nDocument\nAuthor\nMTLD\n\n\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n63.09\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n84.17\n\n\n\n\n\nAn R coding note for those of you who are new to coding. The MTLD computation using koRpus is being put together in the curly brackets that define all the steps that the new function we are defining, calculate_mtld, will perform. NB: calculate_mtlddoes not actually compute MTLD, it just takes a text string (our Tidy data), converts it to a file for koRpus, calls in koRpus to compute MTLD, and then returns everything to Tidy.\nLet’s visualize the results:\n\n# Create a bar plot comparing MTLD\nggplot(mtld_results, aes(x = author, y = mtld, fill = author)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(mtld, 1)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"MTLD Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Length of Sequential Word Strings (Higher = More Diverse)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"MTLD Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, max(mtld_results$mtld) * 1.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, this is interesting and important in understanding how these measures work. Unlike Guiraud, but like TTR, MTLD assigns a greater lexical variety to our mystery text.

    "text": "In this tutorial, we’ll explore three measures of lexical complexity (also called lexical diversity or lexical richness) using two historical texts; one you know well by now, the other one is a new mystery text that you can find on Canvas:\n\n“The Circle of Commerce” by Edward Misselden (1623)\n“A69858.txt”\n\nWe want to see if the two texts differ in terms of vocabulary diversity in a meaningful way.\nWhat is Lexical Complexity? Lexical complexity measures how varied a writer’s vocabulary is. A text with high lexical diversity uses many different words, while a text with low diversity repeats the same words frequently. We’ll learn three different, but well-validated, measures:\n\nType-Token Ratio (TTR) - The simplest measure\nGuiraud Index - Corrects for text length\nMeasure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) - The most sophisticated measure\n\n\n\nWe are going to introduce a new library for MTLD (koRpus). This is a great library to be familiar with because it includes functions for automatics language detection, hyphenation, several indices of lexical diversity (including MTLD), and indices of readability. It’s also well documented and a standard package in academic work.\n\nlibrary(readr) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidyr) \nlibrary(tidytext) \nlibrary(ggplot2) \nlibrary(udpipe)\nlibrary(koRpus)\n\n#install.packages(\"koRpus.lang.en\") # You will need to do this once\nlibrary(koRpus.lang.en)\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 14))\n\n\n# Read the text files\ncircle &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A07594__Circle_of_Commerce.txt\")\nmystery &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A69858.txt\")\n\n# Create a tidy data frame with both texts\ntexts_df &lt;- tibble(\n  document = c(\"Circle of Commerce\", \"A69858\"),\n  author = c(\"Misselden\", \"Unknown\"),\n  text = c(circle, mystery)\n)\n\n# Display basic information\ntexts_df %&gt;%\n  select(document, author) %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(caption = \"Our Two Texts\")\n\n\nOur Two Texts\n\n\ndocument\nauthor\n\n\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have our two texts loaded, let start with Type-Token Ratio (TTR). TTR is the simplest measure of lexical diversity. It’s calculated as:\n\\[\\text{TTR} = \\frac{\\text{Types (unique words)}}{\\text{Tokens (total words)}}\\]\n\n# Tokenize the texts and do some basic cleaning (review week 2 if you are usure!)\ntokens &lt;- texts_df %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = str_to_lower(word))\n\n# Calculate TTR for each text\nttr_results &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  group_by(document, author) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    tokens = n(),                    # Count total words\n    types = n_distinct(word),        # Count unique words\n    ttr = types / tokens,            # Calculate TTR\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Display results\nttr_results %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 3,\n    caption = \"Type-Token Ratio Results\",\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"Author\", \"Total Words\", \"Unique Words\", \"TTR\")\n  )\n\n\nType-Token Ratio Results\n\n\nDocument\nAuthor\nTotal Words\nUnique Words\nTTR\n\n\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n5942\n1317\n0.222\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n33894\n4769\n0.141\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I am using a new function, knitr::kable(x), to display the results as a simple table. It takes whatever is the x (=data frame or matrix) and makes it into a table.\nLet’s visualize the results that we just got:\n\n# Create a bar plot comparing TTR\nggplot(ttr_results, aes(x = author, y = ttr, fill = author)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(ttr, 3)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Type-Token Ratio Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Higher values = more diverse vocabulary\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Type-Token Ratio (TTR)\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, max(ttr_results$ttr) * 1.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this first measure, we see that Misselden’s text has a lower TTR than the unknown one. What does this mean, exactly? Well, we can see that in The Circle of Commerce only 14.1% of the words are new word forms (that is, a word string–after normalization–that has not appeared before in exactly that form in the text so far), while for the “mystery” text, 22.2% of the words are new word forms. That is, TTR is a measure of “non-repetition” of word forms. Another way to think about it is that for The Circle of Commerce, if you encounter any random word in the text, that’s a 14.1% chance that it’s a word type you haven’t seen before. So, The Circle of Commerce has lower lexical variety than A69858: it repeats itself more than A69858.\nWarning: longer texts will almost always have a lower TTR score than shorter texts, even if they have a richer vocabulary (can you see why?). Earlier, we saw that A69858 has, in total, 5942 words, while Circle of Commerce has, in total, 33894. The two texts are substantially different in length, so we need to double check with a length-corrected measure (such as Guiraud and MTLD).\nWhy you might still want to compute TTR: it’s a standard across disciplines and you will encounter it in publications, so you need to know what you are looking at. Anyone reading a corpus analysis will recognize it and be able to understand what it represents. TTR is a standard measure of lexical variety. It’s easy to audit and easy to reproduce. It’s also a good first diagnostic check.\n\n\n\nThe Guiraud Index (also called Root TTR) solves the text length problem by using a mathematical correction:\n\\[\\text{Guiraud} = \\frac{\\text{Types}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Tokens}}}\\]\nBy dividing by the square root of tokens instead of the raw count, the Guiraud Index is more stable across different text lengths. This adjustment is a practical approximation that assumes that as the length of a text doubles, its vocabulary does not double. The square root in the Guiraud index is there because vocabulary growth in texts is empirically sublinear: as a text gets longer, new words appear more slowly. The Guiraud Index essentially asks: how many distinct word forms does a text introduce once we partially correct for the fact that longer texts repeat terms more often?\nCalculate Guiraud Index:\n\n# Calculate Guiraud Index for each text\nguiraud_results &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  group_by(document, author) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    tokens = n(),\n    types = n_distinct(word),\n    guiraud = types / sqrt(tokens),   # Guiraud formula\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Display results\nguiraud_results %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 3,\n    caption = \"Guiraud Index Results\",\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"Author\", \"Total Words\", \"Unique Words\", \"Guiraud Index\")\n  )\n\n\nGuiraud Index Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\nAuthor\nTotal Words\nUnique Words\nGuiraud Index\n\n\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n5942\n1317\n17.085\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n33894\n4769\n25.904\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s visualize it:\n\n# Create a bar plot comparing Guiraud Index\nggplot(guiraud_results, aes(x = author, y = guiraud, fill = author)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(guiraud, 2)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Guiraud Index Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Length-corrected measure of lexical diversity\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Guiraud Index\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, max(guiraud_results$guiraud) * 1.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis result gives a very different picture from what we noticed with TTR: The Circle has a more varied vocabulary than the mystery text when we partially account for the length of the text.\nHowever, you want to make sure that when you compare texts using the Guiraud Index, you are looking at texts that are of similar genre and (though less so) similar length. Different types of texts are associated with different demands on vocabulary and rhetorical strategies (for example, a legal argument will require different vocabulary choice than a news report of the same court proceeding). Because the index still depends on text length and genre, there is no universal ‘benchmark’ scale. Instead, values should be interpreted relatively, as we are doing here.\nThis leads us to:\n\n\n\nWhat is MTLD?\nMTLD is the most sophisticated measure we’ll use. It was designed to account for the problems of the measures above. TTR and Guiraud essentially ask: given a text of length N, how many distinct word forms does it contain? MTLD instead asks: how long can a text continue before its lexical diversity drops below a fixed threshold? It works by:\n\nReading through the text sequentially\nCalculating a running TTR as it goes\nCounting how many times the TTR drops below 0.72 (this has been determined empirically across many text types and genres). Once you detect that the document’s TTR drops below 0.72, you count one factor. Then you reset and restart computing TTR on the next chunk of text.\nThe result is the average “length” needed before vocabulary starts repeating and it’s computed by:\n\n\n\n\nThe Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) is computed as:\n\\[\n\\text{MTLD} = \\frac{N}{F}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\nN = total number of word tokens in the text\nF = total number of factors, including any partial factor at the end of the text\n\nIn practice, MTLD is usually computed in both directions (forward and backward through the text), and the final value is the mean of the two:\n\\[\n\\text{MTLD}_{\\text{final}} =\n\\frac{\\text{MTLD}_{\\text{forward}} + \\text{MTLD}_{\\text{backward}}}{2}\n\\]\nHigher MTLD = more diverse vocabulary (the author can go longer before repeating words).\nLet’s compute this second version (both forward and backward through the text using the koRpus package (and use the formatting that it requires). Note: koRpus gives you a number of options which you can find here.\n\n# Function to calculate MTLD for a text\ncalculate_mtld &lt;- function(text_string, doc_name) {\n  # Create a temporary file (koRpus requirement)\n  temp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".txt\")\n  writeLines(text_string, temp_file)\n  \n  # Tokenize with koRpus\n  tokenized &lt;- tokenize(temp_file, lang = \"en\")\n  \n  # Calculate MTLD\n  mtld_result &lt;- MTLD(tokenized)\n  \n  # Extract the MTLD value\n  mtld_value &lt;- mtld_result@MTLD$MTLD\n  \n  # Clean up\n  unlink(temp_file)\n  \n  return(mtld_value)\n}\n\n# Calculate MTLD for both texts\nmtld_results &lt;- texts_df %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    mtld = calculate_mtld(text, document)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  select(document, author, mtld)\n\nLanguage: \"en\"\nLanguage: \"en\"\n\n# Display results\nmtld_results %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 2,\n    caption = \"MTLD Results\",\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"Author\", \"MTLD\")\n  )\n\n\nMTLD Results\n\n\nDocument\nAuthor\nMTLD\n\n\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\nMisselden\n63.09\n\n\nA69858\nUnknown\n84.17\n\n\n\n\n\nAn R coding note for those of you who are new to coding. The MTLD computation using koRpus is being put together in the curly brackets that define all the steps that the new function we are defining, calculate_mtld, will perform. NB: calculate_mtlddoes not actually compute MTLD, it just takes a text string (our Tidy data), converts it to a file for koRpus, calls in koRpus to compute MTLD, and then returns everything to Tidy.\nLet’s visualize the results:\n\n# Create a bar plot comparing MTLD\nggplot(mtld_results, aes(x = author, y = mtld, fill = author)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(mtld, 1)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"MTLD Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Length of Sequential Word Strings (Higher = More Diverse)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"MTLD Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, max(mtld_results$mtld) * 1.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, this is interesting and important in understanding how these measures work. Unlike Guiraud, but like TTR, MTLD assigns a greater lexical variety to our mystery text. What MTLD is picking up is a difference in how lexical variety is distributed across the text.\nTTR and Guiraud only care about how many distinct word forms there are overall in the texts. They are both global measures of variety.\nMTLD is sensitive to how repetition is patterned through text “time” (think of reading the text as your measure of text “time”). A higher MTLD in the mystery text means that it sustains lexical variety more consistently across its length while Misselden’s lower MTLD means that The Circle includes repetition-heavy chunks earlier on and more often (even though it globally, when adjusted for length, ends up with more unique token types).\nGive this kind of result, we expect that in The Circle, Misselden includes lots of repeated terms and phrases within sections (local repetition as he perhaps defines and explains a given concept/idea), but overall introduces more terms per unit of text length. The mystery text, instead, distributes its vocabulary more evenly. A69858 uses fewer unique words in total, but sustain more lexical variety within any given passage.",

What if we want to understand the complexity (or lack thereof) of the syntax of a text?\nThe core idea that we will use for this is to measure structure via frequency counts (e.g., number of clauses, number of dependent clauses), ratios (e.g., clauses per sentence; dependent clauses per clause), or length indices (e.g., mean length of clause in words).\nNote: research in syntax complexity is particularly well-represented in second language acquisition research (see, for example here for a strong discussion).\nWe are still working with the same two texts as above!\n\ntexts_df &lt;- tibble(document = c(\"Circle of Commerce\", \"A69858\"),\n                   author = c(\"Misselden\", \"Unknown\"),\n                   text = c(circle, mystery)\n                   )\n\ntexts_df\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  document           author    text                                             \n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                            \n1 Circle of Commerce Misselden \"THE CIRCLE OF COMMERCE.

Note: for Early Modern texts there is a package out of Northwestern (MorphAdorner) that performs better.

While someone typing ‘I “like” lemon tea’ changes the meaning from ‘I like lemon tea,’ it doesn’t add to syntactic complexity.\nIf you want to know a bit more about clauses, you can find the full list here.

Let’s do this through five measures. Important: these measures are meant for relative comparison between documents!\n\nCalculate Mean Length of Sentence (MLS): how long are sentences on average?\nCalculate Clausal Density (C/S): how many clauses per sentence?\nSubordination (DC/C, DC/S): how much embedding?\nCoordination (Coord/C, Coord/S): how much coordination?\nPhrasal Complexity (CN/C, CN/S): how complex are noun phrases?\n\nBefore we jump into the details of these measures, we need to aggregate at the sentence level and count syntactic features for each individual sentence:\n\nsentence_df &lt;- syntax_df %&gt;%\n  filter(is_word) %&gt;%           #count words (not punctuation)\n  group_by(document, sentence_id) %&gt;%   #group by document and sentence\n  summarise(\n    words          = n(),   #number of words per sentence\n    clauses        = sum(is_clause), # number of clauses per sentence\n    dep_clauses    = sum(is_dep_clause), #number of dependent clauses per sentence\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nsentence_df\n\n# A tibble: 1,872 × 5\n   document sentence_id words clauses dep_clauses\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 A69858             1    29       1           2\n 2 A69858             2    44       3           2\n 3 A69858             3    45       6           5\n 4 A69858             4    28       1           3\n 5 A69858             5     6       0           0\n 6 A69858             6    39       1           0\n 7 A69858             7    23       0           2\n 8 A69858             8    64       7           5\n 9 A69858             9    35       3           3\n10 A69858            10    27       1           2\n# ℹ 1,862 more rows\n\n\n1. Mean length of sentence: now we measure the average sentence length by number of words. The assumption behind this step is that longer sentences tend to be more syntactically complex.\n\nmls_df &lt;- sentence_df %&gt;%\ngroup_by(document) %&gt;%\nsummarise(\nMLS = mean(words), # Average words per sentence\n.groups = \"drop\"\n)\n\n# Let's take a look\nmls_df \n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  document             MLS\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A69858              22.9\n2 Circle of Commerce  21.2\n\n\n2. Overall Sentence Complexity (C/S = Clauses per sentence): while longer sentences tend to be more complex, that’s not the only way complexity works. A short sentence in English, such as “The dog I saw bit my cousin,” can be structurally complex. The next step is to count clauses. More clauses allow for the possibility of more syntactic complexity via coordination and subordination.\n\n#Calculate clauses per sentence\nclausal_density_df &lt;- sentence_df %&gt;%\ngroup_by(document) %&gt;%\nsummarise(\nsentences = n(),\nclauses   = sum(clauses),\nC_per_S   = clauses / sentences,\n.groups = \"drop\"\n)\n\n# Let's check and how do they compare?\nclausal_density_df\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  document           sentences clauses C_per_S\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A69858                   262     451    1.72\n2 Circle of Commerce      1610    2581    1.60\n\n\n3. Subordination (DC/C and DC/S): this measures how much the author of the text uses dependent clauses (subordination). Subordination creates hierarchical, embedded structures. For example, think of this (monster) sentence: “Although the merchants insisted that the shortage was temporary, and because the city council feared that the unrest would spread unless action were taken immediately, the King decided that he would issue new regulations after he had consulted his advisors.”\nIt contains multiple embedded dependent clauses (“Although…”, “that the shortage…”, “because…”, “unless…”, “that he would…”, “after he had…”), demonstrating how subordination creates a layered, hierarchical structure that is characteristic of complex syntax.”\n\nsubordination_df &lt;- sentence_df %&gt;%\ngroup_by(document) %&gt;%\nsummarise(\nclauses = sum(clauses),\ndep_clauses = sum(dep_clauses),\nsentences = n(),\nDC_per_C = dep_clauses / pmax(clauses, 1), #avoid division by 0 (shouldn't happen, but if no clauses were detected in the sentence, we still want it to run)\nDC_per_S = dep_clauses / sentences,\n.groups = \"drop\"\n)\n\nsubordination_df\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  document           clauses dep_clauses sentences DC_per_C DC_per_S\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A69858                 451         306       262    0.678     1.17\n2 Circle of Commerce    2581        1795      1610    0.695     1.11\n\n\nWhat do these measures mean?\nDC/C (Dependent Clauses per Clause): What proportion of clauses are dependent? Higher value means that there is more subordination relative to total clauses.\nDC/S (Dependent Clauses per Sentence): How many dependent clauses in each sentence on average? The higher the measure, the more embeddings/subordination per sentence.\n4. Coordination (Coord/C and Coord/S): we are next going to measure how much the author use **coordination** (linking clauses with “and”, “but”, “or”). This is a measure of how “horizontal,” rather than hierarchical subordination.\n\ncoordination_df &lt;- syntax_df %&gt;%\ngroup_by(document) %&gt;%\nsummarise(\ncoord_relations = sum(is_coord),\nclauses         = sum(is_clause),\nsentences       = n_distinct(sentence_id),\nCoord_per_C     = coord_relations / pmax(clauses, 1),\nCoord_per_S     = coord_relations / sentences,\n.groups = \"drop\"\n)\n\ncoordination_df\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  document           coord_relations clauses sentences Coord_per_C Coord_per_S\n  &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A69858                         691     451       262        1.53        2.64\n2 Circle of Commerce            4071    2581      1611        1.58        2.53\n\n\nThese are “densities” of coordination:\nCoord/C (Coordination per Clause): Total number of coordination (“and”, “or”, “but”…) markers divided by number of clauses.\nCoord/S (Coordination per Sentence): Total number of coordination markers divided by number of sentences.\nNote: our coordination measure looks high (&gt;2). I bolded “markers” in “coordination markers” because what we are counting is any coordination marker, including in, for example, noun phrases (“trade and commerce”) or in a list of coordinated adjectives (“lawful, honest, and profitable”). So you are not just counting the number of coordinated clauses, but rather the frequency of parallel syntactic structures.\n5. Phrasal Complexity (CN/C and CN/S): writing increases in complexity not just through clauses, but through elaborated phrases. This is especially common in specialized or technical writing. Noun phrases are phrases built around a noun (or pronoun) that act as a unit in a sentence (if you are rusty on noun phrases aka nominal phrases, check this wikipedia entry).\n\nnominal_df &lt;- syntax_df %&gt;%\ngroup_by(document) %&gt;%\nsummarise(\ncomplex_nominals = sum(is_complex_nominal),\nclauses          = sum(is_clause),\nsentences        = n_distinct(sentence_id),\nCN_per_C         = complex_nominals / pmax(clauses, 1),\nCN_per_S         = complex_nominals / sentences,\n.groups = \"drop\"\n)\n\nnominal_df\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  document           complex_nominals clauses sentences CN_per_C CN_per_S\n  &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A69858                          994     451       262     2.20     3.79\n2 Circle of Commerce             5828    2581      1611     2.26     3.62\n\n\nAs a way to understand the difference between clausal and phrasal complexity, look over this example:\n\nMore clauses: The ship was large and fast and was in port. (Not great construction, but plenty of phrases).\nMore complex phrase: The large fast ship was in port.\n\nLet’s bring everything together:\n\n# Combine all measures\nall_measures &lt;- mls_df %&gt;%  # ← Added mls_df %&gt;%\n  left_join(clausal_density_df %&gt;% select(document, C_per_S), by = \"document\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(subordination_df %&gt;% select(document, DC_per_C, DC_per_S), by = \"document\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(coordination_df %&gt;% select(document, Coord_per_C, Coord_per_S), by = \"document\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(nominal_df %&gt;% select(document, CN_per_C, CN_per_S), by = \"document\")\n\nall_measures %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(\n    digits = 2,\n    col.names = c(\"Document\", \"MLS\", \"C/S\", \"DC/C\", \"DC/S\", \n                  \"Coord/C\", \"Coord/S\", \"CN/C\", \"CN/S\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\nMLS\nC/S\nDC/C\nDC/S\nCoord/C\nCoord/S\nCN/C\nCN/S\n\n\n\n\nA69858\n22.85\n1.72\n0.68\n1.17\n1.53\n2.64\n2.20\n3.79\n\n\nCircle of Commerce\n21.23\n1.60\n0.70\n1.11\n1.58\n2.53\n2.26\n3.62\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s visualize it\n\n# Reshape for plotting\nsyntax_long &lt;- all_measures %&gt;%  # ← Added %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -document,\n    names_to = \"Measure\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Category = case_when(\n      Measure == \"MLS\" ~ \"Sentence Length\",\n      Measure == \"C_per_S\" ~ \"Clausal Density\",\n      Measure %in% c(\"DC_per_C\", \"DC_per_S\") ~ \"Subordination\",\n      Measure %in% c(\"Coord_per_C\", \"Coord_per_S\") ~ \"Coordination\",\n      Measure %in% c(\"CN_per_C\", \"CN_per_S\") ~ \"Phrasal Complexity\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Plot\nggplot(syntax_long, aes(x = Measure, y = Value, fill = document)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~Category, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Syntactic Complexity: Complete Profile\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing multiple dimensions of syntactic complexity\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Value\",\n    fill = \"Document\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, we have numbers and pretty pictures, but what does this all mean? Looking at these numbers, my take away is that the two texts are fairly similar in syntactic complexity. The mystery text has marginally longer sentences with more clauses, while Misselden’s text shows slightly more elaborate noun phrases. But nothing remarkable. Both texts employ comparable levels of subordination and coordination, suggesting similar levels of structural sophistication in their writing.\nGiven that the results for both texts are nearly identical (differences of 0.1-0.2 across most measures), I (and most researchers) would conclude these texts show no meaningful difference in syntactic complexity. Of course, this is a rather limited example, where I am comparing just two texts. If I had a large corpus, then I would want to take a more rigorous approach. We will come back to this over the next couple of weeks.",

    "text": "A Quick Aside: Fixing Spelling with Regex\nWhen looking at the data from week 2, you may have noticed some unusual characters (see, for example, the print out of the tibble “word_counts”). We need to make some decisions on how to handle them. This is where regular expressions come in. Regular expressions, abbreviated to regex, are a way to define patterns within strings. It will be helpful to get familiar with the package stringr (which we have used before without comment) by looking at the documentation here.\n\nlibrary(readr) \nlibrary(dplyr) \nlibrary(stringr) \nlibrary(tibble)  \n\ncircle_raw &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A07594__Circle_of_Commerce.txt\") \n\ntext_tbl &lt;- tibble(   \n  doc_title = \"The Circle of Commerce\",   \n  text = circle_raw \n  )  \n\n# Taking a look at text_tbl (or at least part of it since it's very long):\ntext_tbl %&gt;% select(doc_title)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  doc_title             \n  &lt;chr&gt;                 \n1 The Circle of Commerce\n\nnchar(text_tbl$text)\n\n[1] 191605\n\nstr_sub(text_tbl$text, 1, 400)\n\n[1] \"THE CIRCLE OF COMMERCE.

O man kill n\"\n\n\nBefore we change any parts of the text, we are going to preserve the original text in case we change our mind later on. So we are creating a new tibble named text_tbl that contains the original text in a column named text_original:\n\ntext_tbl &lt;- text_tbl %&gt;%\n  mutate(text_original = text)\n\nIn early modern print, the long s (ſ) represents the same letter as the modern s (both were used in print). When it appears explicitly in transcription or OCR, we can safely normalize it to a modern s. In historical texts, regex is often used for normalization, not “correction.” the long s isn’t an error, it’s just a variant (as the British “colour” vs. the American “color” are variants of the same word).\nRegular expressions allow us to:\n\nidentify patterns in text, and\nreplace them systematically.\n\n\n text_tbl &lt;- text_tbl %&gt;%   \n  mutate(     \n    text_clean = str_replace_all(text_original, \"ſ\", \"s\")   \n    )  \n\n\n# Let's count how many \"ſ\" we had before and after to check that the substitution worked:\n\ntibble(\n  long_s_before = str_count(text_tbl$text_original, \"ſ\"),\n  long_s_after  = str_count(text_tbl$text_clean, \"ſ\")\n)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  long_s_before long_s_after\n          &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1          4517            0\n\n\nA bit of warning:\n\nWe replace only the explicit character ſ\nSometimes, the long S is represented as an “f” in transcribed/OCR’ed texts, but I do not recommending trying to guess when an f “should be” an s. Make sure that you know why! If not, ask!\n\nFinally, to pick up another loose thread from Week 2, we can use regex to selectively keep some punctuation and symbols. Remember that we used unnest_tokens to tokenize our text, but we learnt that it automatically removes punctuation. We can set that parameter to FALSE and keep all punctuation. But we can also be more selective. For example, if I only want to keep currency markers (British pounds for our texts), apostrophes, and hyphens, I can do the following:\ntext_tbl &lt;- text_tbl %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    text_clean = str_replace_all(text_clean, regex(\"[[:punct:]&&[^£'-]]\"), \" \") # note I am writing over \"text_clean\", we could also create a new                                                                                       column instead\n  )\nNB: “^ at the start of a character class in regex means”NOT”. I am removing all punctuation except the list I am defining.\n\nStandardizing Name Spellings:\nEarly Modern spelling was not standardized, meaning that the same word may have been spelled in a number of different ways by the same author within the same document. Name spelling was also not standardized and this fact presents some serious problems for us. While it’s pretty easy to decide that “friend” = “freind” (a peculiar spelling by the poet John Milton) for normalization processes, standardizing names in historical texts is not a neutral preprocessing step. It requires biographical and historical research.\nIf we decide that, for example, Smythe, Smyth, and Smith all refer to the same name, we are making a scholarly claim about identity, authorship, and equivalence across spelling variation. Different research questions may require different choices. Therefore, name standardization rules should always be documented and justified as part of your research.\nHaving said that, how would we go about standardizing the variant of Smith?\nThe first step is to define an explicit standardization map. This step will seem excessive right now, but if you are standardizing a large number of words, this vector will keep track of your decisions and it can be expanded as you go.\n\nname_map &lt;- c(   \n\"Smythe\" = \"Smith\",   \"Smyth\"  = \"Smith\",   \"Smithe\" = \"Smith\" \n)\n\nNow, we do not want to simply “search and replace” based on this map. The name-place “Smythfield” (which I am making up right now) should not be replaced by “Smithfield.” What we want to replace is the specific string “Smyth”. To do this, we have to think about word boundaries and typesetting (we want to catch all versions of the name regardless of case):\n\ntext_standard &lt;- text_tbl %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    text_norm = text_clean %&gt;%\n      str_replace_all(regex(\"\\\\bSmythe\\\\b\", ignore_case = TRUE), \"Smith\") %&gt;%\n      str_replace_all(regex(\"\\\\bSmyth\\\\b\",  ignore_case = TRUE), \"Smith\") %&gt;%\n      str_replace_all(regex(\"\\\\bSmithe\\\\b\", ignore_case = TRUE), \"Smith\")\n  )\n\nThe code above uses \\\\b to denote the word boundary. This syntax is peculiar to R (in Python is would be \\b instead). The boundary matches the position between: a word character ([A–Z a–z 0–9 _]) AND a non-word character (space, punctuation, start/end of string). So, \\\\bSmithe\\\\b will catch: “Smithe”, “Smithe.”, “Smithe)”, etc. but not Smithefield.\nNote also that I added a new column with mutate, called text_norm. This way, the original column text_clean is not changed.\n\n\n\nDescribing the Text: N-grams and Trade\nLet’s start to explore how The Circle of Commerce talks about “trade.” Last week we focused on single words and on all bigrams. But there are limitations to what word counts and context-free bigrams tell us about a text. What if we wanted to know more than just how often the word “trade” is used? An obvious, first question is to ask how Misselden describes trade in The Circle: is he focusing on “domestic trade” or “foreign trade”? Does the think that “trade is growing” or that “trade is declining”? We can start exploring these kinds of relationship by using n-grams containing the word trade. The first steps of this analysis will be a bit of review.\nI am going to focus on bigrams as it will keep the lesson clean and easy to follow. Let’s start by setting up the needed packages (in addition to the ones we already loaded):\n\nlibrary(tidyr) \nlibrary(tidytext) \nlibrary(ggplot2) \nlibrary(forcats)\n\nBigrams tell us which words tend to appear next to each other in our text. But their raw frequencies can be dominated by turns of phrase (such as “the trade” or “this trade”) that may or may not be helpful in our analysis. So we will have to make some decisions on how to clean the texts and how to interpret our results.\nWe are going to start by tokenizing into bigrams.

But what about trade related terms, such as “commodities” or “exchange”? How do their bigrams fit in?\nLet’s create a trade lexicon and check:\n\ntrade_lexicon &lt;- c(\n  \"trade\", \"traffick\", \"traffic\", \"commerce\", \"merchant\", \"merchants\",\n  \"exchange\", \"export\", \"import\", \"commodity\", \"commodities\",\n  \"navigation\", \"shipping\", \"market\", \"markets\"\n)\n\ntrade_theme_bigrams &lt;- bigrams_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(word1 %in% trade_lexicon | word2 %in% trade_lexicon) %&gt;%\n  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  unite(\"bigram\", word1, word2, sep = \" \")\n\ntrade_theme_bigrams %&gt;% slice_head(n = 25)\n\n# A tibble: 25 × 2\n   bigram                    n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1 merchants adventurers    35\n 2 free trade               20\n 3 natiue commodities       17\n 4 forraine commodities     16\n 5 cloth trade              10\n 6 exchange betweene         8\n 7 commodities exported      5\n 8 commodities imported      5\n 9 low exchange              5\n10 politique exchange        5\n# ℹ 15 more rows\n\ntrade_theme_bigrams %&gt;%\nslice_head(n = 20) %&gt;%\nmutate(bigram = fct_reorder(bigram, n)) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = n, y = bigram)) +\ngeom_col() +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"Trade-theme bigrams (lexicon-based)\",\nx = \"Count\",\ny = NULL\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now see that “natiue commodities” and “forraine commodities” are almost as important as “free trade” in The Circle of Commerce, and “merchants adventurers” is even more prominent.\nWarning: while my lexicon tracks the alternate spelling for “traffic” (= “traffick”), it doesn’t account for other possible spelling variations (such as “native” = “natiue”). In addition, it treats the variations as distinct words, so that “native plant” is being counted as a different bigram from “natiue plant.” This is fine (in my opinion) at this exploratory stage, but it’s something that will need addressing in our analysis down the line.\n\nFor your own entertainment: test your understanding of regex by standardizing “traffick” to “traffic” in the text upstream of the bigram analysis.\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Analysis:\nSo far, we have explore the language around trade (and trade-related words), but what about the sentiment of this language? Sentiment analysis is a pretty standard technique in NLP projects, but, as we discussed in class, it doesn’t translate smoothly to specialized and historical discourse. For our purposes, we will want to create a targeted sentiment analysis where we measure sentiment only in passages near “trade” (and related terms), instead of across the whole document. This will give us more granular insight over the documents’ tone around the concept of trade.\nLet’s compare The Circle of Commerce (1623) to the earlier text, Free Trade (1622). We will do this in steps:\n\nDefine a trade keyword set (e.g., trade/commerce/merchant).\nExtract token windows around each keyword occurrence (±30 words). There is no hard and fast rule on the size of the window that you want to select. I settled on 30 as a good estimate/guess based on my experience in reading Early Modern texts.\nCompute sentiment inside those windows only.\nCompare two texts.\n\nLet’s start the usual way:\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncircle_raw &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A07594__Circle_of_Commerce.txt\")\nfree_raw   &lt;- read_file(\"texts/B14801__Free_Trade.txt\")\n\ntexts_miss &lt;- tibble(\n  doc_title = c(\"Circle of Commerce\", \"Free Trade\"),\n  text = c(circle_raw, free_raw)\n)\n\nWe are going to do some basic normalization:\n\ntexts_miss &lt;- texts_miss %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    text_norm = text %&gt;%\n      str_replace_all(\"ſ\", \"s\") %&gt;%   # long s as above\n      str_replace_all(\"\\\\s+\", \" \") %&gt;% # collapse whitespace\n      str_to_lower()\n  )\n\nNote: I am adding a line to collapse whitespace because historical texts can have irregular spaces due to archaic typography. We want to remove extraneous whitespaces and replace them with a single whitespace, such as “The circle of commerce” –&gt; “The circle of commerce.” This problem is not unique to historical texts: as you are aware, social media posts don’t always adhere to the best typesetting (or spelling or grammar…) rules!\nImportant: since we are going to want to create a window of 30 words around our target trade terms, we are going to need to keep track of the position of each word in the document. We do this with the index (token_id).\n\ntokens &lt;- texts_miss %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text_norm, token = \"words\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(doc_title) %&gt;%\n  mutate(token_id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nTo make sure that you understand what we are doing above, start by reviewing unnest_tokens from week 2. That should give you a sense of why we want token_id = row_number. Finally, inspect tokens in RStudio–does it look the way you expect it to?\nNext, we are going to identify where our target terms (in this case, I am going to look at “trade”, “commerce”, “merchant”, and “merchants”, but you can play around with these choices) are in the texts:\n\ntrade_terms &lt;- c(\"trade\", \"commerce\", \"merchant\", \"merchants\")\n\ntrade_hits &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  filter(word %in% trade_terms) %&gt;%\n  select(doc_title, hit_word = word, hit_token_id = token_id)\n\nNow that we have located the position of the trade terms (trade_hits), we can create the ±30 token window around them:\n\nwindow_size &lt;- 30\n\ntrade_windows &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  inner_join(trade_hits, by = \"doc_title\") %&gt;%\n  filter(token_id &gt;= hit_token_id - window_size,\n         token_id &lt;= hit_token_id + window_size) %&gt;%\n  mutate(window_id = paste(doc_title, hit_token_id, sep = \"_\"))\n\nA couple of notes about the code above:\n\nI gave you a link to information about joins last week, go back to it to understand inner_join.\nWhen you run this code, you will get a warning about “an unexpected many-to-many relationship”: this is fine and expected. Our target words appear frequently in the documents (they are, after all, mercantile documents about trade) and so the windows we are creating are overlapping, leading R to warn us about this issue. You can silence the warning if you want.\n\nLet’s take a look at what one window looks like:\n\ntrade_windows %&gt;%\n  filter(window_id == nth(unique(window_id), 10)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(window_text = str_c(word, collapse = \" \")) %&gt;%\n  pull(window_text) %&gt;%\n  cat()\n\nvnfitnesse of my pen to represent such pieces so also had i not the happines to attend those then or these since in any of their assemblies as did other merchants whereby my discourse might haue receiued some life and force from their worth and influence their good acceptation of my poore endeauours together with the approbation of many other noble\n\n\nJust as you expected (right?), this is a 61-token window centered around one of our target words (“merchants” in this case).\nNow we are reading to actually compute sentiments. Tidytext gives us access to a number of sentiment lexicons. We are going to use a binary one, bing (by Bing Liu and his collaborators), that categorizes words into positive or negative. As we discussed at the onset, this is not going to be historically accurate, but it will give us a reasonable baseline.\nWe are going to get into the code details in a second, but let’s start with the reasoning behind this approach:\n\nWe are going to look at all the 61-token windows around “trade”, “merchant”, etc.\nMatch words to the sentiment dictionary\nCount: how many positive words vs negative words in each window?\nCalculate a net score: positive count minus negative count [so, a window with 5 positive, 2 negative → net = +3 (overall positive)].\n\nThe code looks like this:\n\nbing &lt;- get_sentiments(\"bing\")\n\nwindow_sentiment &lt;- trade_windows %&gt;%\n  inner_join(bing, by = \"word\") %&gt;%  # keeps only sentiment-bearing words\n  count(doc_title, window_id, sentiment) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(net_sentiment = positive - negative)\n\nNext, we create an overall summary of sentiments for each text. First:\n\nWe are going to find all occurrences of trade-related tokens and create a fixed size “window” around each term.\nWe then inner_join those tokens to the Bing sentiment lexicon so that each token can be labeled as either positive or negative. In this step, if a token doesn’t appear in the Bing lexicon, it gets dropped (a window that contains no Bing words will have no rows in window_sentiment). This means that n() is counting rows of window_sentiment. That is, n() counts the number of word-tokens matched in Bing, aggregated by doc_title.\n\nThen, from window_sentiment, we compute:\n\nThe number of positive and negative Bing-matched token occurrences (so, if “good” appears five times, it contributes five positive occurrences) in our trade-related window.\nThe total net sentiment (= positive - negative)\nThe average net sentiment per sentiment-bearing window = net_sentiment / n_distinct(window_id) . That is, the denominator is the number of windows with at least one Bing match.\n\n\ntext_sentiment_summary &lt;- window_sentiment %&gt;%\n  group_by(doc_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    windows = n(),\n    total_positive = sum(positive),\n    total_negative = sum(negative),\n    total_net_sentiment = sum(net_sentiment),      \n    avg_net_per_window = mean(net_sentiment),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\ntext_sentiment_summary\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  doc_title          windows total_positive total_negative total_net_sentiment\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1 Circle of Commerce     338            556            327                 229\n2 Free Trade             249            404            310                  94\n# ℹ 1 more variable: avg_net_per_window &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nBased on this summary, we can start to see that The Circle of Commerce uses more positive language around the trade-related terms that we selected. To get a better handle of this, we are going to plot the distribution of sentiment scores across all the trade windows for each document as a bar graph:\n\nggplot(window_sentiment, aes(x = net_sentiment)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ doc_title, ncol = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sentiment in Trade-Centered Windows (±30 words)\",\n    x = \"Net sentiment (positive - negative) per window\",\n    y = \"Number of trade windows\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum about Sentiments:\nWe want to be careful in how we interpret sentiment analysis. What we are computing above is a score based on the common (standard?) usage of terms such as “wonderful” or “happy” or “depressing”, where we label certain terms as expressing either positive or negative sentiments. These are of course deeply cultural questions. We all know the stereotypes of Italians being effusive while the British are reserved (as an Italian I do not in the least approve of this absolutely terrible and unfair statement)–does a “great!” from two different speakers mean the same level of positive approval?\nThe past is culturally different to the present and we have to be very careful with sentiment analysis with historical texts. The correct solution would be to create our own, historically based lexicon by becoming familiar with the writing style and linguistic nuances of the 17th century and then scoring terminology (or better yet passages and phrases) for positive or negative sentiments. This is obviously labor intensive. But competent text analysis on any specialized language (historical, medical, legal, etc) requires expertise and care.",

To begin answering this question, we will compare word frequency between two of his works: Free Trade (London, 1622) and The Circle of Commerce (London, 1623).

For this week, I am using generic “file_a” and “file_b” names to simplify the rather complex original file names. We will discuss the naming conventions of these files as well as how to deal with XML files (the original format of Misselden’s texts) in the next few weeks, but for now, I want you to focus on getting them into the appropriate format for analysis.\n\n# You will need the correct file paths if you don't follow my naming conventions:\nfile_a &lt;- \"texts/A07594__Circle_of_Commerce.txt\"\nfile_b &lt;- \"texts/B14801__Free_Trade.txt\"\n\n# Read the raw text files into R\ntext_a &lt;- read_file(file_a)\ntext_b &lt;- read_file(file_b)\n\n# Combine into a tibble for tidytext workflows\ntexts &lt;- tibble(\n  doc_title = c(\"Text A\", \"Text B\"),\n  text = c(text_a, text_b)\n)\n\ntexts\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  doc_title text                                                                \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                                               \n1 Text A    THE CIRCLE OF COMMERCE.

    "text": "Tokenization, stopwords, and counting words:\nWe will turn each text into a table of one word per row, this is the tokenization process in Tidy. Tokens are the basic unit of text that we are working on and the process of tokenization “breaks down” the text into these units for computational analysis. For right now, we are going to consider each word to be a token, but we could break up the text into characters or parts of words if needed. We will then we remove stopwords (words like “the” or “and” that are not useful for this analysis) so that the remaining words are more meaningful for comparison.\nWe will do this in two steps:\n\nStopwords: we will create an “all stopwords” list by combining tidytext’s built-in list with our own, corpus-specific, list. Our list is going to be a one-column tibble to match the format of the built-in stopwords:\n\n\n# Start with tidytext's built-in stopword list\ndata(\"stop_words\")\n\n# Add our own project-specific stopwords (you can, and will, expand this list later)\ncustom_stopwords &lt;- tibble(\n  word = c(\n    \"vnto\", \"haue\", \"doo\", \"hath\", \"bee\", \"ye\", \"thee\"\n  )\n)\n\nall_stopwords &lt;- bind_rows(stop_words, custom_stopwords) %&gt;%\n  distinct(word)\n\nall_stopwords %&gt;% slice(1:10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n   word       \n   &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 a          \n 2 a's        \n 3 able       \n 4 about      \n 5 above      \n 6 according  \n 7 accordingly\n 8 across     \n 9 actually   \n10 after      \n\n\nNext we are going to create a function that tokenizes the texts, removes both standard and custom stopwords, and then counts which words appear most frequently in each document. As you look over this section, you will want to become familiar with the pipe in R (%&gt;%).\n\ntexts is a tibble where each row corresponds to a document;\nunnest_tokens(word, text): splits the text column into individual word tokens, creates a new column called word, and expands the tibble so each row is now one word occurrence\nmutate: here we are normalizing all words to lower case. This is a research decision: I want to count words like “Money,” “MONEY,” and “money” as the same token, so that I can ask how often the texts talk about “money” regardless of capitalization. Note: mutate is part of the dplyr package.\nanti_join: this is where we remove the stopwords we defined earlier and keeps only the tokens that should (we think!) give us the information we want. Look over the information on joins here and make sure that you understand what it’s doing and understand why the tibble format is important! We will be using anti_join frequently.\nFinally we count.\n\n\nword_counts &lt;- texts %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = str_to_lower(word)) %&gt;%\n  anti_join(all_stopwords, by = \"word\") %&gt;%\n  count(doc_title, word, sort = TRUE)\n\nword_counts\n\n# A tibble: 7,438 × 3\n   doc_title word            n\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Text A    trade         233\n 2 Text A    exchange      186\n 3 Text B    trade         185\n 4 Text A    ſo            184\n 5 Text A    malynes       158\n 6 Text A    merchants     126\n 7 Text A    mony          118\n 8 Text A    hee           115\n 9 Text A    kingdome      113\n10 Text A    commodities    96\n# ℹ 7,428 more rows\n\n\nNote: unnest_tokes(word, text) removes punctuation and lowercases automatically. You can a try couple of options to solve this issue. The first is to change a couple of parameters in the function: unnest_tokens(word, text, strip_punct = FALSE) to keep the punctuation and unnest_tokens(word, text, to_lower = FALSE) to keep upper cases. What if you want to keep only certain symbols and types of punctuation? We will discuss this at the beginning of Week 3.",

    "text": "Comparing word frequencies across texts\nLet’s compare how individual words differ across texts after stopword removal through a first visualization. To keep the visualization readable, we focus on the top 20 most frequent words overall. For now, we won’t get into all the details of the visualization code; we will focus on the main components.\nThe goal of this visualization is a side-by-side comparison plot showing the top 20 most frequent words across the texts with one facet per text. Note: these are the same words for both texts. This means that we are creating a direct comparison of how Misselden uses the most frequent terms.\n\nWe start by putting word_count in the correct format with pivot_wider: each word will have a column for each document’s count.\nvalues_fill = 0: if a word never appears in a text, it gets a 0 instead of NA.\nNext, we rank words based on this criterion: for each word, look at how often it appears in Text A and how often it appears in Text B, and keep the largest count.\n\nThis is what is achieved by computing the row-wise maximum with pmax and then defining the vector: max_n = pmax(TextA, TextB).\nmutate() adds a column to word_comparison_tbl (the wide version of word_count we are defining in this block) based on how we just defined max_n (that is: it takes the vector and attaches it as a column to the tibble).\narrange(desc(max_n) sorts the words from most to least frequent based on max_n.\n\n\n\nStop and regroup:\nI have just implicitly (sneakily) introduced some new things and you might find it helpful to take a look at this introduction to data structures. We will reinforce this topic as we go so don’t panic if this is new to you!\n\n\nBack to the code:\nWe have produced a wide, ranked comparison table. We want to turn into a tidy table that can easily be plotted. To do this we need three main steps:\n\nselect the top 20 words to plot (based on our ranking criterion above). We will do this with slice_head(n = plot_n_words), which takes the first plot_n_words of word_comparison_tbl.\nreshape from wide to long to please ggplot: we will talk about ggplot more in the future, but, for now, we can treat it as a blackbox that produces nice visualizations.\norder the words for the plot with mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, n, .fun = max)). Note: here too, I am asking you to take this as a blackbox for now. What this step is trying to solve is the problem (for us) that a character vector has no inherent order.\n\nFinally we plot!\n\nplot_n_words &lt;- 20  # you can change this as needed\n\n# Select the most frequent words overall\nword_comparison_tbl &lt;- word_counts %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = doc_title,\n    values_from = n,\n    values_fill = 0\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(max_n = pmax(`Text A`, `Text B`)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(max_n))\n\nword_plot_data &lt;- word_comparison_tbl %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = plot_n_words) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(`Text A`, `Text B`),\n    names_to = \"doc_title\",\n    values_to = \"n\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, n, .fun = max))\n\nggplot(word_plot_data, aes(x = n, y = word)) + #black magic happens thanks to ggplot\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~ doc_title, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most frequent words (stopwords removed)\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\n      \"Top \", plot_n_words,\n      \" words by maximum frequency across both texts\"\n    ),\n    x = \"Word frequency\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()",

    "text": "Bigrams: starting to think about context\nSingle-word frequencies tell us which terms are common, but they don’t tell us about the context of these words. Our next step will be to try to get a first, basic understanding of how words in our texts fit together. Bigrams allow us to see which words appear together, capturing short phrases and recurring ideas. This is also our first step towards exploring formulaic language,and discursive patterns, rather than just isolated vocabulary.\n\nYou should be able to understand the syntax of this first step (make sure that you do!):\n\n\nbigrams &lt;- texts %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = \"ngrams\", n = 2)\n\nbigrams\n\n# A tibble: 53,816 × 2\n   doc_title bigram           \n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Text A    the circle       \n 2 Text A    circle of        \n 3 Text A    of commerce      \n 4 Text A    commerce the     \n 5 Text A    the prooeme      \n 6 Text A    prooeme herodotvs\n 7 Text A    herodotvs in     \n 8 Text A    in his           \n 9 Text A    his clio         \n10 Text A    clio reportes    \n# ℹ 53,806 more rows\n\n\nCurrently, each bigram is stored as a single string.

Shouldn’t we just tokenize the text into individual words, clean the stopwords, and then find the bigrams?\nLet’s test this out with a phrase such as: “strong economy of international trade.” If we do bigrams first, we get: “strong economy”, “economy of”, “of international”, “international trade.” Removing stopwords will give us: “strong economy”, “international trade” (make sure this makes sense to you).\nIf we cleaned the stopwords first, the phrase would turn into: “strong economy international trade.” The bigrams would then be: “strong economy”, “economy international”, “international trade.” We now have an “extra” bigram, “economy international” (can you see why?).\nNB: there will be situations where the second method (clean first, bigrams second) may be the better option! Think of the phrase: “the state of the art.” The clean first method will give us “state art,” while our method (bigrams first, clean second) won’t capture this at all. The bigram “state art” is a distortion of the concept “the state of the art”–which method is better depends on the question you are asking, but you need to be aware that the choices you make have downstream effects.",

Remember: we started by (somewhat artificially) asking how the language of the two texts differ.

Let’s implement what we learned in class by comparing the two Misselden’s texts to “mystery” text A06785.txt.\nTo create a DFM of the three texts, we will use the quanteda package. We start by loading the packages, reading the texts, and combining into a quanteda corpus named corp.\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(quanteda)\nlibrary(quanteda.textstats)\n\ntxt_circle    &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A07594__Circle_of_Commerce.txt\")\ntxt_free      &lt;- read_file(\"texts/B14801__Free_Trade.txt\")\ntxt_third     &lt;- read_file(\"texts/A06785.txt\")\n\ntexts &lt;- c(\n  \"Circle_of_Commerce\" = txt_circle,\n  \"Free_Trade\"         = txt_free,\n  \"Third_Text_A06785\"  = txt_third\n)\n\ncorp &lt;- corpus(texts)\n\nWe then tokenize and do some basic cleaning (most of this should be very familiar by now):\n\ntoks &lt;- tokens(\n  corp,\n  remove_punct   = TRUE,\n  remove_numbers = TRUE,\n  remove_symbols = TRUE\n)\n\ntoks &lt;- tokens_tolower(toks)\n\ncustom_stop &lt;- c(\n  \"vnto\",\"haue\",\"doo\",\"hath\",\"bee\",\"ye\",\"thee\",\"hee\",\"shall\",\"hast\",\"doe\",\n  \"beene\",\"thereof\",\"thus\" \n)\n\ntoks &lt;- tokens_remove(toks, pattern = c(stopwords(\"en\"), custom_stop))\n\nThe choices that we made when tokenizing do matter! Note that I doing the following:\n\nI am removing punctuation. With this decision, I am asserting that for this analysis, punctuation doesn’t matter (so I want to treat “commerce.” = “commerce!” = “commerce”). You may disagree! If were were doing an analysis of style, then punctuation would matter a lot.\nI am removing numbers. Since these are mercantile texts (including the “mystery” one), it may seems weird to remove potential economic data. My choice is based on a concern for distracting or inaccurate numbers (such as pagination or rounded guesses about population and trade estimates). Again, you may disagree and want to keep them (that’s an easy fix in the code above).\nI am removing symbols. This goes hand-in-hand with the choice about numbers. Most symbols are going to be transcription/OCR errors. The only (likely) valuable ones are currency markers. Since I opted to remove numbers, I decided to remove symbols.\n\nAs I have taken pains to demonstrate, these are all decisions that you can change. But you have to have a principled reason to do so!\nNow we can build the DFM using quanteda’s dfm() and inspect it to make sure that it looks reasonable:\n\n# Document-feature matrix (DFM)\ndfm_mat &lt;- dfm(toks)\n\n# Inspect by raw count (in our corpus) the top 25 features \ndfm_mat\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 3 documents, 9,083 features (56.93% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n                    features\ndocs                 circle commerce prooeme herodotvs clio reportes croesvs\n  Circle_of_Commerce     14       25       1         1    2        1       1\n  Free_Trade              1       22       0         0    0        0       0\n  Third_Text_A06785      41       31       0         0    0        0       0\n                    features\ndocs                 king lydia ſonne\n  Circle_of_Commerce   35     1     5\n  Free_Trade           53     0     0\n  Third_Text_A06785    36     0     0\n[ reached max_nfeat ... 9,073 more features ]\n\ntopfeatures(dfm_mat, 25)\n\n      trade    exchange commodities       money   merchants         may \n        602         478         293         290         282         272 \n        one      moneys       great    kingdome         now        made \n        268         267         214         188         187         186 \n       said          ſo        much           p     malynes       cloth \n        186         184         183         170         162         162 \n      value     without        time       price        upon         man \n        150         148         147         146         145         142 \n    whereby \n        133 \n\n\nOK, so far so good. This is a sparse matrix and the top features seem quite plausible. We could also use this as a way to (potentially) remove some more stop words (I am not sure that “one” or “now” are giving us much information). I am going to keep things as they are. In the aggregate, stopwords won’t be a problem for what we are doing today (this is an empirical statement based on experience; I present no evidence for this here), and we are going to have a better way to get rid of overly common terms in the next section.\n\nFor your entertainment: try playing around with stopwords and difference choices in the tokenization step.\n\nTo compare the documents, we are going to use the second new library we introduced today: quanteda.textstats. It will gives us a number of ways to compare our three texts. We are going to try two of them and compare the results.\n\nFirst:\nLet’s start with a correlation measure. We are going to treat each document as a word frequency vector. So, if we have N words in our corpus, each document is represented by an N-dimensional vector based on the frequency of each word within that text. The vectors are simply the rows of the DFM (where each row is a document).\nWhat we are going to measure in this step is the pairwise Pearson correlation between the vectors across all the word features (the columns of the DFM).\n\n# correlation similarity\nsim_cor &lt;- textstat_simil(\n  dfm_mat,\n  method = \"correlation\",\n  margin = \"documents\"\n)\nsim_cor\n\ntextstat_simil object; method = \"correlation\"\n                   Circle_of_Commerce Free_Trade Third_Text_A06785\nCircle_of_Commerce              1.000      0.569             0.505\nFree_Trade                      0.569      1.000             0.441\nThird_Text_A06785               0.505      0.441             1.000\n\n\n\n\nSecond:\nNow that we understand how each document is represented at a vector, we can measure the distance between them as vectors by measuring the angle between them. We do this using cosine similarity (as discussed in class). We just have to change the method in textstat_simil().\n\nsim_cos &lt;- textstat_simil(\n  dfm_mat,\n  method = \"cosine\",\n  margin = \"documents\"\n)\n\nsim_cos\n\ntextstat_simil object; method = \"cosine\"\n                   Circle_of_Commerce Free_Trade Third_Text_A06785\nCircle_of_Commerce              1.000      0.596             0.533\nFree_Trade                      0.596      1.000             0.471\nThird_Text_A06785               0.533      0.471             1.000\n\n\nIn both cases, we (reassuringly) got 1.000 down the diagonal (each text is perfectly similar to itself) and the matrices are symmetric (can you see why this should be the case?). We also notice that the two texts by Misselden are more similar to each other than to the “mystery” text in both measures. This is also good news since the third text is by a different author.\nThe third text is Gerard Malynes’s The Center of the Circle of Commerce (1623). Malynes and Misselden disagree over governmental intervention in trade, and their works address each other’s arguments.\n\nQuestion for you: given that Malynes’s work is closely related to Misselden’s what do you think of the measures of similarity we just computed? As you think about this, remind yourself of how the DFM is set up.\n\n\n\n\nTF-IDF:\nNot all words are created equal in a document. We know this because we remove stopwords and we even create custom stopwords to account for idiosyncratically common words. This can be due to historical context or to technical, but non-characteristic language. For example, my research is on 17th century Puritan sermons and the use of the word “Scripture” is not a particularly distinguishing feature of these texts. But, as I say of many things in this class, this is a value judgement and dependent on technique. It may turn out that keeping a common word such as “Scripture” in my corpus would actually produce better results. By making these decisions explicit in a stopwords list, we can always retrace our steps.\nThe downside of relying on stopwords is that, in a sense, we have to take educated guesses at which words don’t carry enough discriminating meaning between texts for our corpus. This is where TF-IDF comes in.\nThere are two components to TF-IDF:\n\nTerm frequency (TF), which captures how often a word appears in a document (what we have been counting when setting up the DFM)\nInverse Document Frequency (IDF), which measures how rare a word is across the corpus. A word that appears in only a few documents will have high IDF. This means that a word with high IDF can be a distinguishing feature for a document. \\(\\text{IDF} = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{number of total docs}}{\\text{number of docs with term}}\\right)\\)\n\nNote: quanteda gives you the option to use either natural or base 10 log. The default is base 10. See the full documentation here. In some other applications, you will see a preference for natural logarithm. The difference between the two is really irrelevant (it’s easy to apply a change of base) and what matters is the compression. What the log does: it keeps the monotonic property of IDF (rarer words get higher IDF values), but it won’t let something like a typo in one document dominate.\n\n\nTF-IDF is just the product of TF with IDF. [Note: we should really say TF-IDF(t,d), that is, for term t in document d, but the short-hand skips that parenthetical.] Quanteda will do all the work for us.\nLet’s go ahead and see how TF-IDF changes our DFM matrix:\n\ndfm_tfidf &lt;- dfm_tfidf(dfm_mat)\n\ndfm_tfidf\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 3 documents, 9,083 features (56.93% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n                    features\ndocs                 circle commerce   prooeme herodotvs      clio  reportes\n  Circle_of_Commerce      0        0 0.4771213 0.4771213 0.9542425 0.4771213\n  Free_Trade              0        0 0         0         0         0        \n  Third_Text_A06785       0        0 0         0         0         0        \n                    features\ndocs                   croesvs king     lydia    ſonne\n  Circle_of_Commerce 0.4771213    0 0.4771213 2.385606\n  Free_Trade         0            0 0         0       \n  Third_Text_A06785  0            0 0         0       \n[ reached max_nfeat ... 9,073 more features ]\n\ntopfeatures(dfm_tfidf, 20)\n\n      ſo     upon   moneys  foreign     alſo       us     unto kingdome \n87.79031 69.18258 47.01637 41.50955 37.21546 34.82985 33.39849 33.10516 \n    ſuch     said  becauſe    realm    theſe ballance forraine    thoſe \n32.92137 32.75297 31.96712 30.53576 29.58152 29.10440 29.10440 28.62728 \n    muſt  malynes     loss  balance \n28.62728 28.52678 28.15015 24.81031 \n\n#Note: so far, dfm_tfidf is a quanteda object that has a compact storage format.

I don’t mean that it’s technically wrong: the code is correct and the visualization is displaying the correct terms for each document. However, I made some choices along the way that resulted in some less than illuminating results.\n\nWhat would you change? Why? Hint: think through the discussion about how TF-IDF is computed and what it captures.\nHow would you change it? Hint: you may want to review the lesson from week 3.",

    "text": "So far, we have been focusing on counting words and other features as a way to represent texts and to compare them to each other. What about modeling meaning? The basic intuition that we are going to work with is that we can learn a lot about the meaning of words by looking at their relational properties. That is:\n\na word’s meaning is constrained by its neighbors (“bank account” vs. “river bank”)\nmeaning emerges from patterns of use\n\nLater on in the semester, we will discuss the limitations of this approach (which some of you have already touched on in class by asking about sarcasm and irony, but there are objections derived from ordinary language philosophy that we need to address), but first we need to learn how to implement this intuition about meaning and to extract as much as we can from it!\nToday’s tutorial is preparing you for the next core concepts in the class:\n\nEmbeddings\nSemantics\nWord2Vec\nBERT-style models\n\nWe are going to do this with one of the foundational texts of modern economics, Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776). By the standards of this course, this is a positively modern text!\nYou will find the wealth.txt file under files on Canvas.\n\n\nStarting with out intuition that a word’s meaning is constrained by its neighbors, we have to define what we mean by “neighbors.” We are going to work with “windows” as the unit of analysis. The idea is that we place a window of fixed size across tokens and we record which words appear together.\nLet’s get started:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(readr) \nlibrary(tidyr) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nand let’s keep the same naming pattern we have developed in the previous tutorials:\n\nraw_text &lt;- read_file(\"texts/wealth.txt\")\n\ntexts &lt;- tibble(\n  doc_title = \"wealth.txt\",\n  text = raw_text\n)\n\ntexts\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  doc_title  text                                                               \n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                                                              \n1 wealth.txt \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\\r\\…\n\n## Bonus tip: another way to read a text that makes it easier to change later in the code:\n# file_path &lt;- \"wealth.txt\"\n# raw_text &lt;- read_file(file_path)\n\nGreat. Now we need to tokenize the text. Because we want to build windows that move through the text in order, we need to preserve token order (so we do not disregard word/token order the way we did in bag of words approaches).\n\ntokens &lt;- texts %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%\n  group_by(doc_title) %&gt;%\n  mutate(token_id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n#Let's take a quick look \ntokens %&gt;% slice(1:20)\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   doc_title  word         token_id\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n 1 wealth.txt an                  1\n 2 wealth.txt inquiry             2\n 3 wealth.txt into                3\n 4 wealth.txt the                 4\n 5 wealth.txt nature              5\n 6 wealth.txt and                 6\n 7 wealth.txt causes              7\n 8 wealth.txt of                  8\n 9 wealth.txt the                 9\n10 wealth.txt wealth             10\n11 wealth.txt of                 11\n12 wealth.txt nations            12\n13 wealth.txt by                 13\n14 wealth.txt adam               14\n15 wealth.txt smith              15\n16 wealth.txt contents           16\n17 wealth.txt introduction       17\n18 wealth.txt and                18\n19 wealth.txt plan               19\n20 wealth.txt of                 20\n\n\nFor this tutorial, we are going to try to get a sense for how Adam Smith discusses the term “labor” (side note: for the sake of simplicity, I normalized “labour” to “labor” before providing the file to you). This means that we are going to consider the token “labor” to be our anchor term and we will create windows around it. Important: a window size of 5 means that we are trying to capture 5 tokens on each side of our anchor.\nSelecting an anchor:\n\nanchor &lt;- \"labor\" #this allows you to change this as needed\nwindow_size &lt;- 5\n\n#check how many anchor words are in the text\ntokens %&gt;% filter(word == anchor) %&gt;% count()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      n\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1  1011\n\n\nOK, now we know that there are plenty of our anchor tokens, but we also need to know where they are so that we can find the windows around them.\n\nanchor_hits &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  filter(word == anchor) %&gt;%\n  select(doc_title, anchor_id = token_id) # organize by location of anchor position\n\n#Let's take a look at the tibble\nanchor_hits\n\n# A tibble: 1,011 × 2\n   doc_title  anchor_id\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 wealth.txt        35\n 2 wealth.txt        61\n 3 wealth.txt        74\n 4 wealth.txt        81\n 5 wealth.txt       114\n 6 wealth.txt       147\n 7 wealth.txt       166\n 8 wealth.txt       230\n 9 wealth.txt       487\n10 wealth.txt       521\n# ℹ 1,001 more rows\n\n\nThe next step is the key to our analysis: we begin by pairing each anchor occurrence with every token in the document so that we can calculate distances between them. Once those distances are known, we filter down to the tokens that lie within a fix window around the anchor. So, let’s build the window table!\nPlease make sure that you understand the concepts behind the following block of code:\n\n# Each row in `windows` will be ONE token that appears near ONE anchor occurrence.\n\nwindows &lt;- anchor_hits %&gt;%\n  # Join each anchor occurrence to ALL tokens in the same document.\n  # This is a \"many-to-many\" join because one anchor hit matches many tokens [remember we had a similar set up last week].\n  left_join(tokens, by = \"doc_title\", relationship = \"many-to-many\") %&gt;%\n  \n  # Compute how far each token is from the anchor.\n  # Negative distance = to the LEFT of the anchor; positive = to the RIGHT.\n  mutate(distance = token_id - anchor_id) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Keep only tokens within the window size (±5 tokens).\n  filter(abs(distance) &lt;= window_size) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Remove the anchor word itself (distance 0) so we only keep context words, which is what we are interested in.\n  filter(distance != 0) %&gt;%\n  \n  \n  mutate(\n    window_id = paste0(doc_title, \"_\", anchor_id),\n    anchor_word = anchor\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Keep only the columns we need for the next steps.\n  select(\n    doc_title,\n    window_id,\n    anchor_word,\n    anchor_id,\n    token_id,\n    distance,\n    word\n  )\n\nwindows %&gt;%\n  arrange(anchor_id, distance) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:20)\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 7\n   doc_title  window_id     anchor_word anchor_id token_id distance word      \n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       30       -5 in        \n 2 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       31       -4 the       \n 3 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       32       -3 productive\n 4 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       33       -2 powers    \n 5 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       34       -1 of        \n 6 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       36        1 and       \n 7 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       37        2 of        \n 8 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       38        3 the       \n 9 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       39        4 order     \n10 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       40        5 according \n11 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       56       -5 i         \n12 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       57       -4 of        \n13 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       58       -3 the       \n14 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       59       -2 division  \n15 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       60       -1 of        \n16 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       62        1 chapter   \n17 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       63        2 ii        \n18 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       64        3 of        \n19 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       65        4 the       \n20 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       66        5 principle \n\n\nNow, each row in windows represents one word that appeared near one specific occurrence of the anchor. Next, we can collapse all the context window rows into a single ranked list by adding them up. This will measure how many times any given word appears within ±5 window_size tokens of the anchor across the whole document.\n\ncooc &lt;- windows %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE, name = \"cooc_n\")\n\ncooc\n\n# A tibble: 1,085 × 2\n   word    cooc_n\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 the       1146\n 2 of        1122\n 3 and        400\n 4 in         248\n 5 to         211\n 6 which      166\n 7 wages      158\n 8 produce    149\n 9 a          145\n10 is         142\n# ℹ 1,075 more rows\n\n\nSo you can view cooc_n as a tally of contextual proximity. Note: cooc_n does not tell you whether a word is important! It just tells you that it appears frequently (or not) near the anchor. At this point of the analysis, you can see that very common words (such as “is,” “the,” and “which”) rise to the top of the list. This is a problem as common words end up dominating even when they tell us little about the anchor–this is expected since we are using raw counts.\nYou may want to stop me and complain: well, why didn’t you remove stopwords? Wouldn’t that fix this? This is a reasonable complaint and removing stopwords would help but not solve the issue. Removing stopwords can make the co-occurrence list look more meaningful, but you will still have words that are very common in the document itself appear near any anchor word. We have a better way to solve the common word problem for this particular task…\n\n\n\nWith the raw co-occurrence count we are tracking the words that appear near the anchor most often. What we are going to compute using PMI is the words that appear near the anchor more often than we would expect given how frequently those words occur in the text overall. This makes PMI a better measure of association strength, rather than simple proximity.\nPointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{PMI}(w, a) = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P(w, a)}{P(w)\\,P(a)} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(P(w,a)\\) is the probability that the word \\(w\\) appears in the anchor’s context window\n\\(P(w)\\) is the overall probability of the word \\(w\\) in the document\n\\(P(a)\\) is the overall probability of the anchor word \\(a\\) in the document\n\nIf PMI is high, the word \\(w\\) appears near the anchor more often than we would expect by chance, given how frequent each word is overall. Reference if you want a deeper dive into PMI, see Appendix J in Jurafsky and Martin.\nFirst, we compute the overall word frequencies in the document, \\(P(w)\\) and \\(P(a)\\):\n\ntotal_tokens &lt;- nrow(tokens)\n\nword_freq &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  count(word, name = \"word_n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(p_word = word_n / total_tokens)\n\nword_freq\n\n# A tibble: 10,228 × 3\n   word      word_n     p_word\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 0            440 0.00115   \n 2 0d             1 0.00000261\n 3 1            192 0.000502  \n 4 1,000,000      2 0.00000523\n 5 1,001,171      1 0.00000261\n 6 1,101,107      1 0.00000261\n 7 1,200,000      1 0.00000261\n 8 1,214,583      1 0.00000261\n 9 1,243,120      1 0.00000261\n10 1,245,808      1 0.00000261\n# ℹ 10,218 more rows\n\n\nWe now get anchor frequency and probability:\n\nanchor_stats &lt;- word_freq %&gt;%\n  filter(word == anchor) %&gt;%\n  transmute(anchor_n = word_n, p_anchor = p_word)\n\nanchor_stats\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  anchor_n p_anchor\n     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1011  0.00264\n\n\nGut check: you might (or not) think that these tibbles look weird! At this stage, we are seeing the documents exactly as the computer sees it: a long sequence of tokens. Numbers appear here because Adam Smith uses a lot of numbers (which shouldn’t surprise us!). This gives us a baseline picture of overall frequency, which PMI will later use to decide whether a word’s appearance near the anchor is genuinely informative or merely a byproduct of being common everywhere.\nNow we need to compute \\(P(w,a)\\). We define the sample space as all tokens that appear inside any widow around the anchor word, excluding the anchor tokens themselves. You can think of this as the complete collection of all context words around the anchor in The Wealth of Nations. Then \\(P(w,a)\\) is the probability that, if we randomly select one token from all the tokens that occur inside anchor windows, that token is the word \\(w\\).\nIn practice, this means that we do the following:\n\nWe count how many times 𝑤 appears inside anchor windows.\nWe divide by the total number of tokens across all anchor windows.\nThe result is \\(P(w,a)\\).\n\nThis definition allows us to treat co-occurrence as a probabilistic event rather than just a raw count.\n\ntotal_window_tokens &lt;- nrow(windows)\n\np_w_given_windows &lt;- windows %&gt;%\n  count(word, name = \"cooc_n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(p_word_in_windows = cooc_n / total_window_tokens)\n\np_w_given_windows\n\n# A tibble: 1,085 × 3\n   word     cooc_n p_word_in_windows\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1740          1         0.0000989\n 2 30            1         0.0000989\n 3 a           145         0.0143   \n 4 able          3         0.000297 \n 5 about         4         0.000396 \n 6 above         6         0.000593 \n 7 abridge       7         0.000692 \n 8 abridged      1         0.0000989\n 9 abridges      1         0.0000989\n10 absorbed      1         0.0000989\n# ℹ 1,075 more rows\n\n\nThis is effectively P(w| in anchor windows), which is proportional to \\(P(w,a)\\) for our purposes.\nNext, we join baseline frequencies and compute PMI\n\npmi_tbl &lt;- p_w_given_windows %&gt;%\n  left_join(word_freq, by = \"word\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    pmi = log2(p_word_in_windows / (p_word * anchor_stats$p_anchor))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pmi))\n\npmi_tbl\n\n# A tibble: 1,085 × 6\n   word        cooc_n p_word_in_windows word_n     p_word   pmi\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 tenfold          2         0.000198       1 0.00000261  14.8\n 2 abridges         1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 3 ayrshire         1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 4 carron           1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 5 complexly        2         0.000198       2 0.00000523  13.8\n 6 conceives        1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 7 declamation      1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 8 differs          1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 9 fashioning       1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n10 fattened         1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n# ℹ 1,075 more rows\n\n\nThis should start to give us a clearer picture! However, we do have to worry about rare words. PMI can become misleadingly large when cooc_n is very small (e.g., a word appears once in a window).

Which words rise to the top under PMI that did not dominate raw co-occurrence? What kinds of words does PMI “reward” and what kinds does it “punish”?\nFinally, we can visually compare raw co-occurrence:\n\ncooc %&gt;%\n  slice_max(cooc_n, n = 15) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, cooc_n)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = cooc_n, y = word)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = str_glue(\"Top co-occurring words within ±{window_size} of '{anchor}'\"),\n    x = \"Co-occurrence count\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand top PMI (filtered by by co-occurrence threshold):\n\npmi_tbl_filtered %&gt;%\n  slice_max(pmi, n = 15) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, pmi)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = pmi, y = word)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = str_glue(\"Top PMI-associated words near '{anchor}' (cooc_n ≥ 3)\"),\n    x = \"PMI (log2 scale)\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PMI analysis begins to reveal some interesting aspects how Adam Smith talks about labor. By comparing the raw co-occurrence counts with the PMI scores, we can distinguish between words that merely appear frequently throughout the text and words that have a genuinely strong association with the concept of labor.\nDivision and organization (“division” - PMI: 13.5, “divisions” - PMI: 13.1, “subdivisions” - PMI: 13.1): The extremely high PMI for “division” confirms something that you might already know about Smith: the concept of “division of labor” is central to his discussion. For Smith, this is a way to understand human cooperation. This fits in nicely with the results for skilled labor (“skilled” - PMI: 13.1): the appearance of “skilled” and phrases related to men’s labor suggests Smith distinguishes between different types of labor and their respective values or capabilities.\nProductivity and capacity (“productive” - PMI: 12.9, “powers” - PMI: 13.0): Smith consistently discusses labor in terms of its productive capacity and the powers or capabilities it possesses.\nCompensation (“rewarded” - PMI: 13.1, “wages” - appears in raw counts): not a surprising result by any means, but Smith does discuss rewards and wages alongside labor.\nIf you have read Smith’s Wealth of Nations, this isn’t particularly surprising… but that’s the point of this exercise. PMI is doing quite well at picking up features of interest in a complex, 18th century economic text.\n\n\n\n\nWord2Vec will keep the same core intuition (meaning from context), but it will learn dense vectors by predicting words from windows rather than just counting them. While PMI gives us valuable insights into which words are strongly associated with our anchor term, it still relies on explicitly counting co-occurrences within fixed windows. Word2Vec takes this same fundamental intuition, but approaches it from a predictive rather than counting framework. Instead of tallying how often words appear together, Word2Vec trains a neural network to predict context words from anchor words (or vice versa), learning dense vector representations in the process. These vectors capture semantic relationships in a continuous space where similar words cluster together, allowing for operations like analogy reasoning (e.g., “king” - “man” + “woman” ≈ “queen”). This approach compresses the kind of distributional information we’ve been exploring with PMI into compact, efficient representations that can capture nuanced semantic relationships across your entire corpus.\nThe table below summarizes how co-occurrence and PMI connect conceptually to Word2Vec.

    "text": "So far, we have been focusing on counting words and other features as a way to represent texts and to compare them to each other. What about modeling meaning? The basic intuition that we are going to work with is that we can learn a lot about the meaning of words by looking at their relational properties. That is:\n\na word’s meaning is constrained by its neighbors (“bank account” vs. “river bank”)\nmeaning emerges from patterns of use\n\nLater on in the semester, we will discuss the limitations of this approach (which some of you have already touched on in class by asking about sarcasm and irony, but there are objections derived from ordinary language philosophy that we need to address), but first we need to learn how to implement this intuition about meaning and to extract as much as we can from it!\nToday’s tutorial is preparing you for the next core concepts in the class:\n\nEmbeddings\nSemantics\nWord2Vec\nBERT-style models\n\nWe are going to do this with one of the foundational texts of modern economics, Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776). By the standards of this course, this is a positively modern text!\nYou will find the wealth.txt file under files on Canvas.\n\n\nStarting with out intuition that a word’s meaning is constrained by its neighbors, we have to define what we mean by “neighbors.” We are going to work with “windows” as the unit of analysis. The idea is that we place a window of fixed size across tokens and we record which words appear together.\nLet’s get started:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(readr) \nlibrary(tidyr) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nand let’s keep the same naming pattern we have developed in the previous tutorials:\n\nraw_text &lt;- read_file(\"texts/wealth.txt\")\n\ntexts &lt;- tibble(\n  doc_title = \"wealth.txt\",\n  text = raw_text\n)\n\ntexts\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  doc_title  text                                                               \n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                                                              \n1 wealth.txt \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\\r\\…\n\n## Bonus tip: another way to read a text that makes it easier to change later in the code:\n# file_path &lt;- \"wealth.txt\"\n# raw_text &lt;- read_file(file_path)\n\nGreat. Now we need to tokenize the text. Because we want to build windows that move through the text in order, we need to preserve token order (so we do not disregard word/token order the way we did in bag of words approaches).\n\ntokens &lt;- texts %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%\n  group_by(doc_title) %&gt;%\n  mutate(token_id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n#Let's take a quick look \ntokens %&gt;% slice(1:20)\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   doc_title  word         token_id\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n 1 wealth.txt an                  1\n 2 wealth.txt inquiry             2\n 3 wealth.txt into                3\n 4 wealth.txt the                 4\n 5 wealth.txt nature              5\n 6 wealth.txt and                 6\n 7 wealth.txt causes              7\n 8 wealth.txt of                  8\n 9 wealth.txt the                 9\n10 wealth.txt wealth             10\n11 wealth.txt of                 11\n12 wealth.txt nations            12\n13 wealth.txt by                 13\n14 wealth.txt adam               14\n15 wealth.txt smith              15\n16 wealth.txt contents           16\n17 wealth.txt introduction       17\n18 wealth.txt and                18\n19 wealth.txt plan               19\n20 wealth.txt of                 20\n\n\nFor this tutorial, we are going to try to get a sense for how Adam Smith discusses the term “labor” (side note: for the sake of simplicity, I normalized “labour” to “labor” before providing the file to you). This means that we are going to consider the token “labor” to be our anchor term and we will create windows around it. Important: a window size of 5 means that we are trying to capture 5 tokens on each side of our anchor.\nSelecting an anchor:\n\nanchor &lt;- \"labor\" #this allows you to change this as needed\nwindow_size &lt;- 5\n\n#check how many anchor words are in the text\ntokens %&gt;% filter(word == anchor) %&gt;% count()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      n\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1  1011\n\n\nOK, now we know that there are plenty of our anchor tokens, but we also need to know where they are so that we can find the windows around them.\n\nanchor_hits &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  filter(word == anchor) %&gt;%\n  select(doc_title, anchor_id = token_id) # organize by location of anchor position\n\n#Let's take a look at the tibble\nanchor_hits\n\n# A tibble: 1,011 × 2\n   doc_title  anchor_id\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 wealth.txt        35\n 2 wealth.txt        61\n 3 wealth.txt        74\n 4 wealth.txt        81\n 5 wealth.txt       114\n 6 wealth.txt       147\n 7 wealth.txt       166\n 8 wealth.txt       230\n 9 wealth.txt       487\n10 wealth.txt       521\n# ℹ 1,001 more rows\n\n\nThe next step is the key to our analysis: we begin by pairing each anchor occurrence with every token in the document so that we can calculate distances between them. Once those distances are known, we filter down to the tokens that lie within a fix window around the anchor. So, let’s build the window table!\nPlease make sure that you understand the concepts behind the following block of code:\n\n# Each row in `windows` will be ONE token that appears near ONE anchor occurrence.\n\nwindows &lt;- anchor_hits %&gt;%\n  # Join each anchor occurrence to ALL tokens in the same document.\n  # This is a \"many-to-many\" join because one anchor hit matches many tokens [remember we had a similar set up last week].\n  left_join(tokens, by = \"doc_title\", relationship = \"many-to-many\") %&gt;%\n  \n  # Compute how far each token is from the anchor.\n  # Negative distance = to the LEFT of the anchor; positive = to the RIGHT.\n  mutate(distance = token_id - anchor_id) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Keep only tokens within the window size (±5 tokens).\n  filter(abs(distance) &lt;= window_size) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Remove the anchor word itself (distance 0) so we only keep context words, which is what we are interested in.\n  filter(distance != 0) %&gt;%\n  \n  \n  mutate(\n    window_id = paste0(doc_title, \"_\", anchor_id),\n    anchor_word = anchor\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Keep only the columns we need for the next steps.\n  select(\n    doc_title,\n    window_id,\n    anchor_word,\n    anchor_id,\n    token_id,\n    distance,\n    word\n  )\n\nwindows %&gt;%\n  arrange(anchor_id, distance) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:20)\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 7\n   doc_title  window_id     anchor_word anchor_id token_id distance word      \n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       30       -5 in        \n 2 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       31       -4 the       \n 3 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       32       -3 productive\n 4 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       33       -2 powers    \n 5 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       34       -1 of        \n 6 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       36        1 and       \n 7 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       37        2 of        \n 8 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       38        3 the       \n 9 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       39        4 order     \n10 wealth.txt wealth.txt_35 labor              35       40        5 according \n11 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       56       -5 i         \n12 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       57       -4 of        \n13 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       58       -3 the       \n14 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       59       -2 division  \n15 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       60       -1 of        \n16 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       62        1 chapter   \n17 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       63        2 ii        \n18 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       64        3 of        \n19 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       65        4 the       \n20 wealth.txt wealth.txt_61 labor              61       66        5 principle \n\n\nNow, each row in windows represents one word that appeared near one specific occurrence of the anchor. Next, we can collapse all the context window rows into a single ranked list by adding them up. This will measure how many times any given word appears within ±5 window_size tokens of the anchor across the whole document.\n\ncooc &lt;- windows %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE, name = \"cooc_n\")\n\ncooc\n\n# A tibble: 1,085 × 2\n   word    cooc_n\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 the       1146\n 2 of        1122\n 3 and        400\n 4 in         248\n 5 to         211\n 6 which      166\n 7 wages      158\n 8 produce    149\n 9 a          145\n10 is         142\n# ℹ 1,075 more rows\n\n\nSo you can view cooc_n as a tally of contextual proximity. Note: cooc_n does not tell you whether a word is important! It just tells you that it appears frequently (or not) near the anchor. At this point of the analysis, you can see that very common words (such as “is,” “the,” and “which”) rise to the top of the list. This is a problem as common words end up dominating even when they tell us little about the anchor–this is expected since we are using raw counts.\nYou may want to stop me and complain: well, why didn’t you remove stopwords? Wouldn’t that fix this? This is a reasonable complaint and removing stopwords would help but not solve the issue. Removing stopwords can make the co-occurrence list look more meaningful, but you will still have words that are very common in the document itself appear near any anchor word. We have a better way to solve the common word problem for this particular task…\n\n\n\nWith the raw co-occurrence count we are tracking the words that appear near the anchor most often. What we are going to compute using PMI is the words that appear near the anchor more often than we would expect given how frequently those words occur in the text overall. This makes PMI a better measure of association strength, rather than simple proximity.\nPointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{PMI}(w, a) = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P(w, a)}{P(w)\\,P(a)} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(P(w,a)\\) is the probability that the word \\(w\\) appears in the anchor’s context window\n\\(P(w)\\) is the overall probability of the word \\(w\\) in the document\n\\(P(a)\\) is the overall probability of the anchor word \\(a\\) in the document\n\nIf PMI is high, the word \\(w\\) appears near the anchor more often than we would expect by chance, given how frequent each word is overall. Reference if you want a deeper dive into PMI, see Appendix J in Jurafsky and Martin.\nFirst, we compute the overall word frequencies in the document, \\(P(w)\\) and \\(P(a)\\):\n\ntotal_tokens &lt;- nrow(tokens)\n\nword_freq &lt;- tokens %&gt;%\n  count(word, name = \"word_n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(p_word = word_n / total_tokens)\n\nword_freq\n\n# A tibble: 10,228 × 3\n   word      word_n     p_word\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 0            440 0.00115   \n 2 0d             1 0.00000261\n 3 1            192 0.000502  \n 4 1,000,000      2 0.00000523\n 5 1,001,171      1 0.00000261\n 6 1,101,107      1 0.00000261\n 7 1,200,000      1 0.00000261\n 8 1,214,583      1 0.00000261\n 9 1,243,120      1 0.00000261\n10 1,245,808      1 0.00000261\n# ℹ 10,218 more rows\n\n\nWe now get anchor frequency and probability:\n\nanchor_stats &lt;- word_freq %&gt;%\n  filter(word == anchor) %&gt;%\n  transmute(anchor_n = word_n, p_anchor = p_word)\n\nanchor_stats\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  anchor_n p_anchor\n     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1011  0.00264\n\n\nGut check: you might (or not) think that these tibbles look weird! At this stage, we are seeing the documents exactly as the computer sees it: a long sequence of tokens. Numbers appear here because Adam Smith uses a lot of numbers (which shouldn’t surprise us!). This gives us a baseline picture of overall frequency, which PMI will later use to decide whether a word’s appearance near the anchor is genuinely informative or merely a byproduct of being common everywhere.\nNow we need to compute \\(P(w,a)\\). We define the sample space as all tokens that appear inside any widow around the anchor word, excluding the anchor tokens themselves. You can think of this as the complete collection of all context words around the anchor in The Wealth of Nations. Then \\(P(w,a)\\) is the probability that, if we randomly select one token from all the tokens that occur inside anchor windows, that token is the word \\(w\\).\nIn practice, this means that we do the following:\n\nWe count how many times 𝑤 appears inside anchor windows.\nWe divide by the total number of tokens across all anchor windows.\nThe result is \\(P(w,a)\\).\n\nThis definition allows us to treat co-occurrence as a probabilistic event rather than just a raw count.\n\ntotal_window_tokens &lt;- nrow(windows)\n\np_w_given_windows &lt;- windows %&gt;%\n  count(word, name = \"cooc_n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(p_word_in_windows = cooc_n / total_window_tokens)\n\np_w_given_windows\n\n# A tibble: 1,085 × 3\n   word     cooc_n p_word_in_windows\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1740          1         0.0000989\n 2 30            1         0.0000989\n 3 a           145         0.0143   \n 4 able          3         0.000297 \n 5 about         4         0.000396 \n 6 above         6         0.000593 \n 7 abridge       7         0.000692 \n 8 abridged      1         0.0000989\n 9 abridges      1         0.0000989\n10 absorbed      1         0.0000989\n# ℹ 1,075 more rows\n\n\nThis is effectively P(w| in anchor windows), which is proportional to \\(P(w,a)\\) for our purposes.\nNext, we join baseline frequencies and compute PMI\n\npmi_tbl &lt;- p_w_given_windows %&gt;%\n  left_join(word_freq, by = \"word\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    pmi = log2(p_word_in_windows / (p_word * anchor_stats$p_anchor))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pmi))\n\npmi_tbl\n\n# A tibble: 1,085 × 6\n   word        cooc_n p_word_in_windows word_n     p_word   pmi\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 tenfold          2         0.000198       1 0.00000261  14.8\n 2 abridges         1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 3 ayrshire         1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 4 carron           1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 5 complexly        2         0.000198       2 0.00000523  13.8\n 6 conceives        1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 7 declamation      1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 8 differs          1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n 9 fashioning       1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n10 fattened         1         0.0000989      1 0.00000261  13.8\n# ℹ 1,075 more rows\n\n\nThis should start to give us a clearer picture!

What kinds of words does PMI “reward” and what kinds does it “punish”?\nFinally, we can visually compare raw co-occurrence:\n\ncooc %&gt;%\n  slice_max(cooc_n, n = 15) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, cooc_n)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = cooc_n, y = word)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = str_glue(\"Top co-occurring words within ±{window_size} of '{anchor}'\"),\n    x = \"Co-occurrence count\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand top PMI (filtered by by co-occurrence threshold):\n\npmi_tbl_filtered %&gt;%\n  slice_max(pmi, n = 15) %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, pmi)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = pmi, y = word)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = str_glue(\"Top PMI-associated words near '{anchor}' (cooc_n ≥ 3)\"),\n    x = \"PMI (log2 scale)\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PMI analysis begins to reveal some interesting aspects how Adam Smith talks about labor. By comparing the raw co-occurrence counts with the PMI scores, we can distinguish between words that merely appear frequently throughout the text and words that have a genuinely strong association with the concept of labor.\nDivision and organization (“division” - PMI: 13.5, “divisions” - PMI: 13.1, “subdivisions” - PMI: 13.1): The extremely high PMI for “division” confirms something that you might already know about Smith: the concept of “division of labor” is central to his discussion. For Smith, this is a way to understand human cooperation. This fits in nicely with the results for skilled labor (“skilled” - PMI: 13.1): the appearance of “skilled” and phrases related to men’s labor suggests Smith distinguishes between different types of labor and their respective values or capabilities.\nProductivity and capacity (“productive” - PMI: 12.9, “powers” - PMI: 13.0): Smith consistently discusses labor in terms of its productive capacity and the powers or capabilities it possesses.\nCompensation (“rewarded” - PMI: 13.1, “wages” - appears in raw counts): not a surprising result by any means, but Smith does discuss rewards and wages alongside labor.\nIf you have read Smith’s Wealth of Nations, this isn’t particularly surprising… but that’s the point of this exercise. PMI is doing quite well at picking up features of interest in a complex, 18th century economic text.\n\n\n\n\nWord2Vec will keep the same core intuition (meaning from context), but it will learn dense vectors by predicting words from windows rather than just counting them. While PMI gives us valuable insights into which words are strongly associated with our anchor term, it still relies on explicitly counting co-occurrences within fixed windows. Word2Vec takes this same fundamental intuition, but approaches it from a predictive rather than counting framework. Instead of tallying how often words appear together, Word2Vec trains a neural network to predict context words from anchor words (or vice versa), learning dense vector representations in the process. These vectors capture semantic relationships in a continuous space where similar words cluster together, allowing for operations like analogy reasoning (e.g., “king” - “man” + “woman” ≈ “queen”). This approach compresses the kind of distributional information we’ve been exploring with PMI into compact, efficient representations that can capture nuanced semantic relationships across your entire corpus.\nThe table below summarizes how co-occurrence and PMI connect conceptually to Word2Vec.
